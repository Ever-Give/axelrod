Help Finding an Old Story

I've been looking everywhere for an old Persona story that used to be on this sight but I think it was lost.

I'm pretty sure the story's name was Persona 5: Sakura Futaba.

The story was about Futaba going to bed having to pee and waking up before having an accident, but the author included an alternate scenario in a comment after the main story where Futaba doesn't wake up in time and wets the bed.

If anyone could help me find this story (preferably both parts) I'd greatly appreciate it.
