Hello everyone today I decided to make a story based on my favorite character from the Oshi No Ko Manga Series Akane Kurokawa I hope you enjoy

It was a usual day for the blue-haired acting genius, Akane Kurokawa. She was preparing for a stage performance with the help of her boyfriend Aqua and her fellow actress-turned-idol Kana when suddenly during so she felt a slight twinge in her bladder. "I kind of have to pee but it's not too bad for now I think I can hold it." She said in her head before immediately going back to what she was doing, Kana and Aqua looked at her weirdly asking "Are you okay Akane?" Akane shook her head a bit and said "Yes I'm fine it's nothing."

An hour later

Akane wasn't doing very well she was squirming a bit more and she kept taking the time to cross one leg over the other Akane said to herself in her head "I really have to pee now but it seems like I may not get the chance to until after the performance I'll just have to hold it for now." Aqua and Kana noticed her unusual movements but chose to leave them be. Immediately after Akane was done preparing Aqua offered her some water to help her rest a bit before the performance the moment she saw the water in the bottle her control caved in and she leaked a little bit of urine into her blue-striped panties and down her leg. She squealed and grabbed herself with both hands and doubled over she closed her eyes as she began to wet herself with a few hours' worth of urine she had been holding all over her panties, her dress, and her shoes there was a large wet patch everywhere on her dress as she dropped down to the ground and began to cry.
