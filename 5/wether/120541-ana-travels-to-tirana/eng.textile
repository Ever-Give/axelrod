This is the story of Ana, an Albanian student who travels from her home to Tirana, the capital city, where she studies. The journey is long and Ana becomes more and more desperate to pee... The story will be written in few parts, and there are some references to "Ana, the Butring Guide", so I invite the new readers to start with the previous story:

Ana Travels to Tirana — Part 1

It was around ten in the morning, and the area around Friendship Park in Saranda buzzed with life, as if everyone wanted to finish daily errands before the heat became unbearable. That summer, temperatures broke records, and even the sea breeze, usually bringing relief, seemed powerless against the scorching sun today. Ana got off the bus that had brought her from her home village to the bustling city center. The old vehicle, rattling and stuffy, left clouds of exhaust behind, and she, with her backpack slung over her shoulder, looked toward the stop where the bus to Tirana was already waiting. Though departure was still twenty minutes away, passengers crowded inside, fighting for the best seats. Ana sighed—she wanted to stop at a nearby café to use the toilet just in case, but time was short. She had to hurry if she wanted a good seat.

Inside the bus, it was already crowded. Ana looked around and resignedly noticed that only seats on the right side remained—those that would bake in the sun for half the journey. She had no choice. She sat by the window, placing her backpack on her lap, and gazed at the distant ruins of a synagogue. She always wondered why it had been destroyed. Earthquake? War? No one in the area knew the answer, or perhaps no one wanted to talk about it. She drifted into thought, trying to focus on something other than the journey in conditions far from comfortable.

That day, she had woken earlier than usual to pack for university. She dressed modestly, in line with her upbringing and Albanian tradition. She wore a long white skirt reaching her ankles and a white linen blouse with long sleeves, subtly embroidered at the collar. Underneath, she had a simple cotton top and fitted boxers, chosen over traditional çitjane for comfort in the heat. She checked twice in the mirror to ensure the underwear didn’t show through the light fabrics—in her community, modesty was paramount, and the slightest indiscretion could spark gossip. She ate traditional byrek me djathë, a crispy cheese pie, washing it down with çaj mali—mountain tea—to calm her before the long trip. In her backpack, she packed a bottle of ujë me limon, lemon water, but she already knew she had to limit drinking. 

She knew there was no toilet on the bus, and stops, if any, would only come in larger towns along the way. The route to Tirana, though familiar, always stirred slight anxiety in her, and the memory of the incident in Butrint only deepened it. That day, when she nearly lost control in front of tourists, still haunted her like a grim warning. Now, in this heat, with the tempting bottle in her backpack, she had to be careful. Still, she reached for it and took a small sip of refreshing water.

Sitting in the stuffy bus, Ana recalled a conversation with one of the tourists in Butrint. He spoke of train travel—fast, safe, comfortable, with air conditioning and onboard toilets. Nothing like Albanian buses, which jolted on potholed roads, without AC, in crowding and no bathroom access. Ana sighed, dreaming of the day Albania, her beloved homeland, would have modern railways. After all, other mountainous countries like Switzerland, Austria, or even Slovakia had developed networks. And in Albania? The only railway line had been under renovation for years, and Tirana remained perhaps the only European capital unreachable by train. She imagined guiding tourists in elegant carriages, pointing out ancient ruins, hills, and hidden secrets through the windows. She would tell stories of history, Butrint, synagogues—everything that made her love her country.

Her thoughts were interrupted by a voice: “Excuse me, is this seat free?”

Ana looked up and froze. In front of her stood the man in beige shorts and linen shirt, with the same calm but intense gaze she remembered from Butrint. Her heart beat faster, and she felt a slight cramp in her lower abdomen, though her bladder wasn’t seriously troubling her yet. It couldn’t be him… could it? She had no time to wonder—the driver started the engine, and the bus shuddered, slowly pulling away from the stop. Ana clenched her thighs, trying to ignore both the man and the growing pressure in her bladder. She could do nothing—the journey was just beginning, and she already felt another battle awaiting her.

Part 2

“Thank you,” said the man, taking the seat next to Ana. He pulled a paper map from his pocket, surprising her in an age of ubiquitous smartphones. Ana glanced at the crumpled sheet, thinking it rare for anyone to still use such old-fashioned aids. “Excuse me, do you know exactly which way we’re going?” he asked, unfolding the map on his lap.

Ana leaned in slightly, careful not to shift position and provoke her bladder, which was still making itself felt. She traced her finger along the map, pointing out the route. “Probably this way,” she said, trying to sound confident.

“Probably?” The man raised an eyebrow, smiling lightly.

“Yes,” she hesitated, feeling her cheeks warm. “In Albania, routes are sometimes… flexible. They can change mid-journey, depending on who needs what.”

“As long as it gets us to Tirana,” he joked, his smile warm, almost disarming.

Ana glanced at him briefly, trying to assess if it was really the same man from Butrint. Same beige shorts, linen shirt… but was it definitely him? The one there had something unsettling in his gaze, as if he saw more than he should. This one seemed calmer, more ordinary, though she couldn’t shake the feeling she’d missed something. Just thinking about that day—the shame, the struggle with her bladder, the shocking proposal—caused a slight cramp in her lower abdomen. Her cheeks burned with embarrassment, and she quickly looked away, staring out the window. The synagogue ruins were almost out of sight.

The man paused, folding the map, then looked at her again. “Excuse my boldness, but is it possible I saw you in Butrint?” he asked, with a polite tone, almost cautious.

Ana stiffened, her heart racing. “Yes,” she replied quietly, a bit flustered. “I work there as a guide in the summer.” Deep down, she prayed he wouldn’t refer to that incident, her desperate struggle, the conversation that still burned her with shame. If it was him, would he really dare bring it up?

But the man just smiled, as if unaware of her inner turmoil. “If I may say, you tell stories very engagingly and have great knowledge of the region and its history. And I… I like visiting interesting places, old castles. Is there anything else worth seeing nearby?

”The question was innocent, but in the context of Albanian culture, especially in the small community Ana came from, it could be seen as slightly too forward. In her village, conversations with strangers, especially men, were often viewed with reserve, and a young woman had to be careful not to be accused of excessive familiarity. However, on the bus in a more cosmopolitan setting, it seemed natural—just a tourist curious about places to visit. Ana, though slightly embarrassed, decided to respond professionally, like a guide.

Ana took another small sip of lemon water, though she knew she should refrain. The taste refreshed, but each sip reminded her of the risk. “There’s plenty to see around Tirana,” she began, trying to focus on the topic. “For example, the castle in Kruja, linked to our national hero Skanderbeg. Or Petrela, a small castle on a hill with a beautiful view.” As she spoke, she instinctively clenched her thighs, feeling that though it wasn’t bad yet, the coming hours could be challenging.

The man nodded, jotting something on the map’s margin. “Sounds great, thank you. Maybe I’ll run into you as a guide again someday,” he said with a smile, then returned to studying the map, as if not wanting to press.

Ana breathed a quiet sigh of relief, grateful the conversation hadn’t gone in an uncomfortable direction. But when the bus jolted on a bumpy road, the slight shock reminded her of her bladder. She knew several hours of travel lay ahead, without a toilet, in the heat, with the tempting lemon water bottle in her backpack that she shouldn’t touch but whose scent lured her in the stuffiness. Was it really the same man from Butrint? And if so, did he remember that day? More importantly—would she endure this journey without another embarrassment?

Part 3

The bus rattled along bumpy Albanian roads, the sun blazing through the window directly onto Ana. She felt sweat running down her neck, her linen blouse sticking to her back. The heat was unbearable, and the lack of air conditioning in the old vehicle made every breath an effort. In her backpack was the bottle of ujë me limon, its scent was tempting, but Ana was cautious—she knew drinking now was risky. She took only a small sip, feeling the lemony water refresh her throat but also reminding her of the slight pressure in her bladder. It wasn’t urgent yet, not like that day in Butrint. She had peed about three or four hours ago, before leaving home, so she had some reserve. But knowing there was no toilet on the bus and stops were rare and unpredictable made her slightly anxious.

The man beside her, in beige shorts and linen shirt, continued studying his paper map, occasionally glancing out the window. Ana hoped the conversation wouldn’t get too intense—she wanted to focus on the landscape and ignore the growing, though still manageable, discomfort. Olive groves and hills flashed by, and in the distance, the outlines of Gjirokastra’s stone walls appeared, roughly along the way to Tirana.

The bus slowed, and the driver announced briefly in Albanian: “Five-minute stop! Quick, we’re delayed!” They pulled up at a small, rundown gas station, where several passengers pushed toward the exit. Ana considered trying to find a toilet, but the crowd and lack of clear signs made her give up. Five minutes was too short, and the risk of the bus leaving without her too great. She stayed seated, adjusting herself and trying not to think about her bladder slowly making itself known.

The man beside her didn’t get off either. Instead, he pointed to the hill outside where Gjirokastra’s walls loomed. “That’s Gjirokastra, right?” he asked, his voice polite with curiosity. “I heard they have a castle there. Could you tell me something about it?”

Ana sighed with relief—the topic was safe, and talking history always helped distract from other issues. “Yes, that’s Gjirokastra,” she replied, trying to sound enthusiastic despite the sun burning her arm and sweat on her forehead. “The castle dates to the 13th century but was expanded by Ali Pasha in the 19th. There’s a weapons museum, and under the castle are Cold War tunnels, partially open to visitors.” As she spoke, she subtly shifted position, feeling slight pressure in her lower abdomen. It wasn’t bad yet, but she knew she had to be careful.

“Tunnels? Sounds intriguing,” the man said, noting something on the map margin. “And the views from the castle? Worth going up?”

“Definitely,” Ana replied, forcing a smile. “From the top, there’s a panorama of the whole city and Drino valley. It’s one of Albania’s most beautiful places.” Her voice sounded confident, but inside, the heat and slight bladder pressure were starting to wear on her. She reached for the water bottle to moisten her lips but stopped midway. “Not now,” she thought, putting it back. Each sip could shorten her reserve, with hours of travel still ahead.

The man nodded, seemingly satisfied. “You have a talent for describing such places. It’s clear it’s your passion,” he said sincerely, without the unsettling intensity she remembered from Butrint. Or maybe it wasn’t him? Ana wasn’t sure but preferred not to dwell on that day.

The bus started again, bouncing on potholes, each jolt reminding Ana of her situation. The sun no longer shone directly on her, shaded by rocky hills, but the stuffy interior remained hot, air heavy with exhaust and passenger sweat. She knew she had to conserve energy—and bladder capacity—if she wanted to reach Tirana without issues. The Gjirokastra talk was a pleasant distraction, but deep down, Ana wondered how many more stops there would be and if her body would hold out in this rattling, stuffy vehicle.

Part 4

An hour or two later, the bus lurched violently over another pothole, jolting Ana from a light doze. She instinctively clenched her thighs, feeling a sudden, sharp pressure in her bladder. She opened her eyes, heart racing—she really needed to pee now. It wasn’t desperate yet, not like in Butrint, but strong enough to ignore no longer. She looked around, trying to orient herself. The bus moved slowly along a narrow mountain road, steep slopes on one side and a drop on the other, making passing vehicles almost acrobatic. Fortunately, the sun was no longer directly on her, blocked by rocky peaks, but the stuffy interior remained hot, air thick.

Ana instinctively reached for her ujë me limon bottle, only to find it empty. She frowned, trying to recall when she’d drunk it. She must have in half-sleep, unconsciously, worsening her situation. She glanced at the man beside her, in beige shorts and linen shirt. He sat calmly, map on his lap, looking mildly bored, as if the long journey didn’t affect him.

“Do you know where we are?” she asked quietly, trying to sound neutral though the bladder pressure made focusing hard.

The man looked up, shrugging. “Not sure,” he replied. “I think we detoured from the main road. The driver said something—maybe an accident—but I don’t understand Albanian.”

Ana fell silent, frustration building. She was thirsty, needed to pee, sweaty, tired, and not knowing how much longer in this rattling bus only worsened her mood. She tried to stay calm, pretend everything was fine, but her body demanded attention more. She sat stiffly, thighs tightly clenched, trying not to dwell on the growing need.

The man beside her glanced over, as if noticing something. “Are you okay? Maybe some water?” he asked, offering an open bottle of clear liquid that looked like salvation in the heat.

Ana hesitated. She knew she shouldn’t drink—each sip could bring her closer to the disaster whose memory from Butrint still burned her with shame. But her throat was dry, the heat making her feel like on a desert. “Thank you, just a little,” she replied with a forced smile and took a small sip, minimizing it. The water tasted refreshing, but she almost immediately felt her bladder react with a slight cramp.

Meanwhile, the man drank in large gulps, as if unconcerned about the lack of a toilet. Ana watched in disbelief. “How can he drink so much and look like he doesn’t need a bathroom at all?” she thought, cheeks reddening at the memory of Butrint. “And me? I’m about to wet myself…” Shame gripped her throat, but she clenched her teeth and sighed quietly, trying to focus elsewhere.

She knew a stop, if any, was far off. The narrow mountain road offered no place to pull over—rocks on one side, abyss on the other. Even if she asked the driver to stop, she’d have to stand, push through the swaying bus past dozens of eyes that would surely guess why a young woman was desperately heading forward. Worse, she’d first have to ask the man beside her to let her pass. The thought of saying “excuse me, I need the toilet” made her want to sink into the ground.

She clenched her hands on her skirt folds, kneading the fabric as if it could help. She sat rigidly, with thighs firmly pressed, trying to ignore each bus jolt testing her endurance. The landscape outside—beautiful rocky hills with occasional tree clumps—couldn’t distract from the growing discomfort. She knew a long road lay ahead, each minute in this stuffy, rattling vehicle will be a challenge.

*010*2026-02-07 04:27

Part 5

The bus rolled slowly through Tirana’s suburbs, and Ana felt the goal near—the end of this unexpectedly difficult journey. Just a few more intersections, lights, streets, and she’d reach the station, able to run to the toilet. But every minute in the rattling vehicle was a fight. Every road unevenness, pothole, jolt hit her like a punch to the abdomen, straight into her overfull bladder. Her legs, tightly clenched, trembled with effort, muscles slowly failing from hours of tension. Ana’s hands nervously kneaded her skirt near her crotch, as if the gesture could stop the inevitable. She dreamed of slipping a hand between her thighs, holding where it wasn’t proper, to relieve her aching muscles even momentarily. But she couldn’t—not in a bus full of people, not with the man beside her who would surely notice.

Sweat trickled down her temples, her sweaty clothes sticking to her skin. Ana breathed shallowly, occasionally muttering in Albanian: “I’ll hold… I’ll hold…” or, in moments of doubt, “I’m about to pee myself…” She felt her body tremble with effort, shame from Butrint returning in waves, heightening panic. Just a few more minutes—she repeated, staring at passing Tirana buildings signaling proximity.

Suddenly, the man beside her folded his map and looked at her. His voice was quiet, almost sympathetic. “I can see you’re suffering, that you’re at your limit,” he said. “As soon as the bus stops, run. I’ll watch your backpack and wait until you return.”

Ana felt a hot blush flood her face. Shame gripped her throat—he’d noticed. She knew her nervous movements, clenched legs, pale face had betrayed her struggle. She looked at him, unsure what to say, and just nodded, forcing a faint smile. His offer sounded like salvation—she could run to the toilet without worrying about her things. But could she trust him? What if he disappeared with her backpack? What if he rummaged through her notes, wallet, personal items? Before she could respond, the man, as if reading her mind, pulled a small pocket knife with engraved initials from his pocket.

“Don’t worry,” he said, placing it in her hand. “This is my friend, my constant travel companion. I won’t leave without it.”

Ana looked at the knife, surprised, but her thoughts were too scattered to reply. All her focus was on fighting her bladder, not letting disaster happen, not wetting her panties like a little girl in a crowded bus. Just a few more minutes…

The bus pulled into the large station square, the engine coughing to silence. The man stood, making way for Ana. “Go,” he said quietly, and Ana, without thinking, seized the chance. She pushed through passengers toward the doors, but each step was torture, each movement threatening loss of control. Sweaty clothes stuck to her skin, but she didn’t care—only finding the toilet before the worst mattered.

On the square, she spotted a familiar small café from past trips. She pushed the door, praying it was open. Inside, a short queue waited for the toilet—two women. The first, a middle-aged foreign tourist in a light dress and tourist backpack, looked tired. The second, an older Albanian woman with gray hair in a bun, waited calmly. Ana, with legs crossed in desperation, stood behind them, nervously kneading her skirt over her lower abdomen. She felt her body tremble, a first droplet, then another, escaping resistance, leaving a wet spot in her panties. “No, not now… not here…” she pleaded inwardly, clenching her teeth. She looked at the tourist and gathered courage. “Excuse me… can I go first? I’m… I’m really desperate,” she whispered in English, cheeks burning.

The tourist gave her a tired look. “We’re all waiting,” she replied curtly, with a slight accent. “I’ve been traveling for hours without a bathroom too. You are young, you have time, you can wait.”

Her words hit like a blow. Ana lowered her gaze, shame flooding her. Why was this woman, who should understand, so indifferent? Was it fatigue, or did she simply not grasp how humiliating it was to beg for such a thing in Albania? Ana’s thoughts returned to Butrint—that tourist there was at least not so heartless… or was he?

Thank you so much! I'm really glad you like the story and that you're a fan of Ana's adventures, troubles and incidents 🙂

As for the guy next to her... yeah, he definitely knew she was at her absolute limit. Did he enjoy her suffering? Why did he finally let her go? Well... maybe he thought she'd earned it... or maybe he has something else in mind for later 😉

What happens in that tiny cafe toilet? You'll see in the next part. Any guesses – does she make it in time, or is there a little accident after all?

Part 6

Ana waited, clenching her thighs tighter, but her muscles trembled with effort. Another droplet wet her panties in the most intimate spot. Ana bit her lip to keep from crying out in frustration. She was so close, just steps from long-awaited relief, but each second felt eternal. Every moment was torture, other café customers’ glances burning her skin. Finally, the tourist emerged, leaving Ana with the older Albanian woman, who gave her a gentle smile.

“Shko, vajzë, unë mund të pres,” she whispered in Albanian—“Go, child, I can wait.” Her voice was warm, as if sensing Ana’s desperation without words.

Ana, eyes full of gratitude, nodded and rushed into the toilet, nearly tripping on uneven tiles. In desperation, she lifted her skirt, trying to pull down her panties, but the dam broke before she sat. A powerful stream flowed, soaking her underwear before she lowered onto the seat. Ana sat with her face in her hands, peeing and peeing as if it would never end. Slowly, the pain in her lower abdomen eased, replaced by a wave of relief shivering through her body. She straightened, breathed deeply, wiped herself, dried her wet panties as best she could, then washed her hands and splashed her face with water for cooling.

Emerging, she looked at the older woman and whispered in Albanian: “Faleminderit. Thank you.” The woman nodded with a smile, as if it were obvious. Ana left the café, still feeling a mix of relief, shame, and anger at the tourist. How could a woman who should understand be so indifferent? And why had the man from the bus, also a foreigner, been more understanding?

With slight unease, she approached where she’d left the tourist. He stood there, holding her backpack, leaning against a lamp post. “I don’t know how to thank you,” she said quietly, returning the knife with a slight smile.

“I’m glad I could help,” he replied with a smile, looking up at her. His tone was sincere, but something flashed in his eyes that Ana couldn’t interpret. “But that’s all I could do. Maybe we’ll meet again in some ruins someday. Good luck with your studies!” He winked, handed back the backpack, and walked away, vanishing into the crowd.

Ana stood for a moment in the square, trying to shake off the whole situation. Gratitude to the older Albanian who let her go mixed with anger at the tourist who refused understanding. Surprise at the man’s kindness—but who was he? Was it really the same person from Butrint? Or not? If yes, why no mention of that day? How did he know she was a student? She didn’t recall mentioning studies—they only talked about Gjirokastra, castles, history. Maybe something slipped? In her mind, she tried replaying conversation fragments like a damaged tape. And his words: “I’m glad I could help”—what did he mean? Just the backpack, or glad about her desperation, her shame, that she nearly wet herself near him? The thought made her cheeks burn again. Did he notice wet spots on her skirt she tried to hide by adjusting the fabric? Was his wink just friendly, or something more?

Ana’s thoughts returned to dreams she’d had at the journey’s start. She imagined traveling by train—in a comfortable, air-conditioned carriage, the trip to Tirana half as long, bumpy roads and stuffy buses just memories. On a train, she could stand and go to the toilet when needed, without fear of prying eyes or begging for a stop. Perhaps in such conditions, this desperate body struggle and humiliating shame wouldn’t have happened. Albania deserved modern railways to ease life for residents and tourists, and Ana could guide passengers past ruins and hills instead of fighting her bladder in a rattling bus.

She sighed, slinging her backpack over her shoulder. She felt tired, sweaty, still slightly humiliated, but post-toilet relief gave her strength to continue. Tirana pulsed with life—streets full of people, cars, noise. Ana headed toward university, trying to focus on upcoming classes. But deep down, she couldn’t escape the question: who was that man? And why did she have a feeling their paths would cross again?

The end.

But not quite the end.

Ana will return in yet another story. She will have some adventures in her university, and then she will take part in some archeological research in Poland. Who knows, maybae it will become clear (or at least clearer) who the man in beige shirt was...
