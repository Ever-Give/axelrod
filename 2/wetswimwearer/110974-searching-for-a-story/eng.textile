Searching for a story

I think this is the right place to post this on so, here goes. I've been looking for a story that was deleted from Fiction like a year ago. It was titled "Let's make Martha piss herself" and it started with a girl named Isabelle who would drink a lot at night so she could wake up desperate in the morning as a push to finish her homework. One day she accidentally overdid it by forgetting to pee before bed and ended up peeing herself when the bathroom was occupied by her sister Keyleigh, with Martha, her other sibling making fun of her for it. The story continues after that, but I only copied till the part where Isabelle is about to wet herself. Does anyone have the copy of the entire thing? Would be greatly appreciated.
