A small tool

Just a little something I worked on, on the side. It wasn't really something I was intending to post in the first place, or at least that's not why I made it. But I figured that it was fun or interesting enough that people might want to have a go at it. To use this tool, roll six pairs of twelve-sided dice. If you do not own any such dice, Google can do the job for you if you search for "2d12". Any random number generator works too.

You can think of it as a creative writing tool. I haven't used it for my own writing, but I have imagined scenarios based on combinations I have gotten. It's pretty fun. If you get a combination that seems to not make sense at first, the creative exercise is to try to force it to make sense somehow.

If you get some cool combination that sparks your imagination, feel free to post about that too; or, keep it as your secret forever.

The second part of the tool, for generating characters.

I have an alternative AB table for making a fantastical or furry character. It's a bit niche, but I may post those later as well if people want me to.
