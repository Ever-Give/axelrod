Hey everyone, I noticed that the entire roleplay section of the site got taken down. It's a shame because there was a lot of good stories, but I digress. The reason I've made this post is for everyone who still wants to roleplay. I don't mind, so if anyone wants to discuss or offer roleplay scenarios to each other, consider this thread as a new medium, and the same as the old roleplay forum. Good luck everyone, try to find a nice partner and write some rad stories!
