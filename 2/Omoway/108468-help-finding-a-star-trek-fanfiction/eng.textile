There was a fic where Spock had to stay in the med bay for whatever reason and nearly ends up wetting himself/does end up wetting himself. I think Bones eventually helps using a towel or something like that but I can’t quite remember. I can’t find the fic anymore though I’m pretty sure it was on ao3.

There is a similar fic called “Just a Doctor’s Job” but that’s not the one I’m thinking of.

Thank you for any help!
