We’re planning a small private ABDL retreat in a unique setting: a former school that has been converted into a group accommodation. The place still has its original classrooms, a schoolyard, dormitories, and a kitchen, making it the perfect environment to recreate a daycare/nursery school experience for ABDLs.

One of the main activities we’re thinking about is a mock classroom session with a pretend teacher and ABDL "students." The idea is to relive childhood memories in a fun and playful way, especially focusing on a wetting game in class. The goal would be to see who can hold out the longest before having an accident, with prizes for the last one to wet themselves. There could also be bonus points for those who have an accident while standing at the board.

Before finalizing the details, we’d love to hear from you!

Do you have any ideas or suggestions to make this game even more fun? Any variations or extra rules that could add to the experience? Feel free to share your thoughts!
