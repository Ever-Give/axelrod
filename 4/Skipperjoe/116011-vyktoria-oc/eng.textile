Hello all!

This will be my testing ground for my new O/C as I get into writing. Meet Vyktoria!

*CRASH* Thunder erupted from outside, causing Vyktoria to jump. “Damn this storm.” Vyktoria thought to herself. “I’m trying to study here.” The library was packed due to the awful weather, but silent due to the strict librarian, Gwendolyn.

Vyktoria’s leg bounced up and down under the table, causing mild annoyance to those around her. She glanced at her empty water bottle taunting her. “Gosh I need to think these things through. I’m bursting!”

There was no mistaking it, Vyktoria needed to pee. Badly. Under the table her legs jittered and clenched wildly. That last crash of thunder took its toll, she almost let a squirt of pee out of her aching privates. She had held it too long, and was hoping for the library to clear out so no one could see her dance and dash to the bathroom.

She thought to herself, “Gods, if only this magical exam wasn’t so ha-“ *CRASH* Lightning and thunder erupted from the heavens. Vyktoria yelped and jammed her trembling hand into her crotch. A leak. Small. But a leak nonetheless. Her red striped panties now clammy, she needed to make a break for it… and fast.
