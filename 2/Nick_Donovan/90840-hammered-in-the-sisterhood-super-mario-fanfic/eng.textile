Here we are, folks: my very first fanfiction to be posted on this website. It ended up being a lot longer than I'd initially anticipated, with the initial projected count of 2,000 words ending up being double at 4,000. Because of this little prelude I'm posting to explain a few things, I'll just be attaching the Microsoft Word document in which I wrote it to this post. Now something I should probably point out is that, although it's a Super Mario fanfiction, it's my own interpretation of the universe, which is a lot darker than the canonical version.

There's also quite a heavy focus on the matter of religion and general politics throughout, a lot of which comes in the prelude, which may be a big turn-off for some people. I myself am agnostic, so while I'm not an atheist who renounces faith entirely, I'm also not one of the hyper-devoted zealots. I just find the topic very fascinating. But in any case: have a look at the story and see what you think of it.
