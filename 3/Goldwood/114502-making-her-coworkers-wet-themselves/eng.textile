Making Her Coworkers Wet Themselves

Izzy’s Day

The alarm beeped and Isabella Guerrero woke up before hitting snooze, a staple of her routine to get five more minutes of cuddles with her cat while half asleep. Once it beeped again, her workweek was officially underway. While Izzy wasn’t particularly a morning person, the reminder that a new hire was starting that day at work helped make it a little more interesting. She had a fairly run of the mill office job for a data analytics company and a new face would be a welcome change after one of her favorite coworkers moved to Seattle the month before. She finished her shower and put on a nice red blouse with khaki slacks while straightening her dark brown hair. With a final ruffle of her cat’s fur, she was on her way.

Her gut said it would be a long day and she’d left plenty of time to ensure a quick run to the Goldwood Brew. One bagel with cream cheese and iced coffee later, she was on the road and soon parking her RAV 4 in her usual spot at Goldfinch Data. She finished the last few seconds of her Sabrina Carpenter song and checked the clock as she powered it off.

7:54. Right on time.

Izzy headed inside and waved to her coworkers, caught in the usual Monday small talk. Brian’s son won his game on Saturday, Kara went hiking, and Peter was in a bad mood because Goldwood College lost another football game. She finally reached her desk a few minutes past eight. A blonde woman sat at one of the previously empty desks and got up to introduce herself.

“Hi, nice to meet you. I’m Gemma Wade, the new hire.” Gemma gave firm handshake and Izzy couldn’t help noticing how striking her bright blue eyes were. She wore a white dress shirt with a grey pencil skirt and looked around 30. Despite her youth, she carried herself with the confidence of someone who’d worked in the industry for several years compared to the 22 year olds they sometimes hired out of college.

“Izzy Guerrero. I believe we’ll be working together quite a bit.”

“Nice to meet you, Izzy! How big is our team by chance?”

“Six. There’s us, our supervisor Jacob who probably interviewed you, Peter, Kara, and it looks like Mark just walked in now.”

“Mornin’!” Mark said as he walked over. He was a tall guy with brown hair and strong jawline. He wore a navy suit jacket that day with the matching tie that had anchors on it. While Izzy had her life together by most metrics-stable job, her own place, and had recently bought her first new car as an adult, she had been single for nearly two years. A lot of that stemmed from her complete indecision on how to handle “The Mark Problem” as her friends put it. He was good looking, friendly, and single, but he sat right next to her and that was weird, right? There was no rule banning workplace relationships where neither was the other’s supervisor but if it went wrong… She took a sip of coffee before her mind headed down that road again.

Gemma introduced herself to Mark and Izzy joined them in a bit of small talk. Unlike most of the employees who’d graduated from the local Goldwood College, Gemma had graduated from Weathersby University a few hours away. She put up a few photos on her desk of friends from college while asking Izzy about some of hers. Izzy talked through a few of the bachelorette party and vacation photos. Eventually Izzy turned around to hit some emails before her morning meeting. She put headphones in out of habit, but didn’t play any music or podcasts as Mark and Gemma talked a little longer. Gemma didn’t have any assigned work or training yet while Mark was in no hurry to start his day. Izzy nearly turned around to join back in a few times, but wasn’t quite sure what to say. Once Mark got on the topic of football as he often did, Izzy put on some music and sucked down the rest of her coffee. The meeting with TerraCorp was at 10:30 and she a few more reports to get through.

Nine o’clock rolled around bringing a familiar sensation. The coffee and intermittent sips of water had done their damage and Izzy’s somewhat small bladder demanded relief. She had just gotten up when Gemma flagged her over.

“Hey real quick. The bathroom is down that hall, right?” Gemma asked.

Izzy stopped and internally winced at just how full she’d let her bladder get. “Yep! There’s another ladies room on the other side of the floor but this is the one I always use,” Izzy said.

“Okay thanks. I forgot to ask about that on my tour,” Gemma said.

It seemed a pretty important amenity for both the supervisor and new employee to forget about, but Izzy wasn’t going to question it. She rounded the corner and pulled on the door with more force than she intended. Thankfully it was unoccupied. A few drops of pee escaped into her white panties, a much closer call than she’d anticipated.

She opened the door and jumped back as Gemma right stood outside. “Sorry, did not mean to scare you,” Gemma laughed.

“You’re fine! I probably should’ve expected it when you asked where the bathroom was.”

“Well I appreciate the answer. Would not be fun to figure out in a pinch.”

Gemma shut the door behind her and Izzy returned to her desk. With most of her coffee out of her system, she took a swig of water and returned to the TerraCorp report. She had polished off her first glass of the day, but she’d pee again before the meeting to be safe. While Izzy worked, she overheard Jacob walk over and give Gemma some training to work on.

“We’ve got these Monday morning calls with Terra, our biggest client each week. Based on your credentials I’m sure you’ll be sitting in on them by the end of the month,” Jacob said.

“Anything to help,” Gemma said.

Just as Izzy finished reviewing her files for the meeting, another client called. Izzy somewhat reluctantly accepted the call from Stuart, a rather long winded man who loved to hear himself talk while Izzy cycled through her arsenal of “Oh my”s, “That’s crazy”s, and “Tell me about it”s. She hung up the phone and did a double take at the time.

10:27. Her bladder had filled back up and she had just minutes before the meeting.

“Hey Izzy, can you help me find a program?” Gemma asked.

Izzy froze. She needed the bathroom, but she didn’t want to be rude either. Jacob was also in the meeting, so if he wanted Gemma to work on something, she might not be able to access it for another hour. “I’ve got a meeting soon, but I can help you find it if it’s fast.”

“Oh right! I’ll make this quick,” Gemma said. She explained what training resources she was after and Izzy was able to locate it. The new hire thanked her while Izzy checked her phone.

10:29. There was no way she’d keep the client waiting, so she had no choice but to hold it. She sat at the conference room table across from Mark while Jacob shut the door and started the call. “You nervous?” Mark asked as she fidgeted.

“Little bit. Got so many reports for them to keep straight.” It wasn’t exactly a lie, it just wasn’t the reason she was fidgeting. The meeting started with a general overview of upcoming deadlines followed by a spreadsheet where they went through each project in more detail. As Mark and Jacob talked, Izzy tried to take notes as usual in case she needed to help them, but within the first fifteen minutes of the meeting, her mind was already elsewhere.

She needed to pee. Badly. Maybe getting coffee that morning was asking for trouble. Maybe she should’ve told Gemma she needed the bathroom. Maybe she just had terrible luck as Stuart Rinaldi talked about Stuart things cutting into both her preparation and bathroom break time.

“And your thoughts on the Edison project, Izzy?”

Izzy snapped to attention and calmed herself. It wasn't easy as her bladder demanded relief, but she managed to walk the client through the project. She shifted uncomfortably in her chair but at least the next project in line was Mark’s and she could compose herself with the spotlight off.

“Actually while I’ve got you here, Izzy, why don’t we go ahead and cover the Phoenix project as well?”

Izzy froze. That moment of surprise sent a leak into her panties. It wasn't a few drops like she sometimes experienced either. This was a legitimate spurt. “Might as well. Friday I emailed Diane about…” She continued to talk, her fists clenched and her feet practically digging into her rollie chair. She had a few follow up questions to answer and she lost another spurt during those.

“Am I about to piss myself on a conference call?”

No! She had to push through. Mark covered his projects and she only lost one more spurt while positioning herself better. She eyed the clock and saw that unlike some meetings, this one might actually be finished by the estimated end time of 11:30. She crossed her hands in her lap for a hopefully subtle way to hold, though some eye contact with Mark made it clear he was a little worried. Hopefully she could paint this as just feeling sick. She leaked again and a terrible realization hit. She had to stand up, and she was pretty sure she had a wet patch. There was no way to discreetly check so she just had to own it.

Jacob hit “end call” and Izzy went for it. She stood up walked out of the room as soon as possible. She set her stuff down and marched towards the bathroom. Underwear now noticeably damp, she grabbed the handle.

Locked. “Fuck!”

“I’ll be out in a minute,” Gemma said awkwardly.

“It’s okay, I'll just use the other one,” Izzy said. She took off like a madwoman while cursing her terrible luck. Of course the new hire just so happened to be in the bathroom after the meeting ended.

She found the other bathroom which was thankfully unlocked. She shut the door and took two steps before the dam broke right before the toilet. Hot piss spilled down her legs and stained her khaki pants as she frantically ripped her pants off before hobbling to the toilet. She sat on the toilet and tried to hold back the tears but how could she. She had completely pissed herself at age 27. She pulled her pants back up and dabbed up as much pee as she could with paper towels but it didn’t do much. There was no way she could go back to her desk in this state.

She fired off an email to Jacob telling her she felt sick and was going home. She wove through the office taking all sorts of weird routes to dodge coworkers. She triumphantly reached the parking lot when she saw Mark hang up his phone.

“Hey Iz…” his voice trailed off as he saw what there was no hiding.

“Rough day at the office,” Izzy mumbled.

“Anyone else know?”

“Hopefully not.”

Mark put a hand on her shoulder and suddenly Izzy wanted nothing more than to collapse into his arms, even if he was just a coworker. “Your secret’s safe with me.”

Mark’s Day

The alarm blared and Mark Henderson hit the general vicinity of his alarm clock a few times before landing on what was hopefully snooze and not “alarm off”. He was back asleep before he could linger too much on that. He snoozed two more times like usual before getting up to check his computer. He felt the usual rush as he found his favorite website and logged in.

Despite a seemingly average life, Mark had a secret. It wasn’t dark per se, just a bit embarrassing. Growing up he had discovered that he had a pee fetish and that eventually led him to YellowFlow.net. He’d been a member for years with admittedly too many hours spent writing fiction, commenting on people’s experiences, or roleplaying with other members. He clicked the notification bell and smiled at the dopamine hit. Not only did he have a comment on his latest post, it was from WetCrystal. Crystal had been his favorite “pee friend” over the years, even if he knew little about her beyond her name.

In addition to her comment on his post, she’d also opened the possibility of another roleplay which Mark accepted without question. Somewhere between browsing comments and posts, Mark snapped back to reality and remembered he had work soon. He considered skipping a shower, but the new girl was starting he wanted to look at least decent. He showered and dressed himself fast enough to offset most of the time he wasted, not that anyone at work was super productive on a Monday morning anyway. He grabbed a pack of pop tarts and put on some Aerosmith for the drive. As he powered off his car, he checked the clock.

8:07. Right on time.

He walked to his desk and waved as Izzy introduced herself to the new hire, Gemma. Hired within a few weeks of each other, Mark had always had a bit of a thing for Izzy, though he remained unsure if and how he would even make the first move. They were friendly with one another and regular had lengthy conversations on slow days to kill time, but was there anything beyond that? Starting a relationship would also mean scaling things back with Crystal and he wasn’t sure he was ready for that either.

But he wasn’t going to deal with that on a Monday morning. Izzy turned around to work on the TerraCorp files while Mark chatted things up with Gemma. The first thing he noticed about her was her confidence. She had the poise of someone who’d been in the industry for years and would be in management sooner rather than later. Despite that, there was also a humbleness, someone willing to learn and see how her new company worked before sprinkling in her own ideas. She talked about Weathersby University and hung up photos from her sorority days, Omega Mu Omega based on the house in one of the photos. Mark didn’t have many decorations himself, just a few photos of his family and a Tampa Bay Buccaneers bobble head.

“Must be a football fan I take it,” Gemma said, looking up from the bobblehead to Mark’s background of Tom Brady hoisting the Lombardi trophy after winning Superbowl LV.

“Yeah. The Bucs haven’t been the greatest team, but they won one Super Bowl when I was a kid and another as an adult. All one can ask for really,” Mark said. His love for the Bucs had also inspired his username on a certain other website, PuddlePirate. As Gemma set down her water bottle, a gallon one with timestamps to get through the day, Mark found himself wondering how often she’d have to pee or if any chances to see her desperate would arise.

Eventually Jacob arrived to give Gemma a tour followed by some training materials as Mark reviewed files before the TerraCorp call. He later heard footsteps as Izzy got up and Gemma asked where the bathroom was.

“Good thing to ask, based on that giant water bottle,” Mark thought to himself with a laugh.

Then something unexpectedly spiced up a boring Monday. Izzy got tied up on the phone with Stuart and Gemma asked her for help, completely eliminating her shot at a bathroom break before the meeting. Mark took his usual spot and Izzy sat down across from him. She shifted subtly in her chair and Mark’s heart started racing. Izzy had a fairly small bladder based on the frequency of her bathroom trips. She had both had coffee that morning and missed her opportunity for a second pee before the meeting. A piece of Mark felt guilty for being excited at her expense, but it wasn’t like he did anything to cause the situation. If his cute coworker was about to get desperate, who was he to turn down an opportunity to enjoy something out of his control?

“You nervous?” Mark asked as she shifted again.

“Little bit. Got too many projects to keep straight,” Izzy said.

The meeting started fairly routinely with a general catchup on where the projects stood. Mark made sure that following the meeting was priority one, but priority two was getting harder to resist. Izzy continues to fidget in her chair. At first it was some subtle shifting, but before long she was sitting on her foot and squirming around. She regained her composure once it was her turn to speak, but then the client threw a curveball and asked about the Phoenix project rather than going down the list.

Izzy froze and Mark could’ve sworn he saw her gasp. She talked about the project, but continued to squirm in her chair. As Mark watched, a conflicting emotion was rising. What if Izzy somehow had an accident? No one deserved to go through that at work, particularly in a boardroom meeting. She clearly had to pee, and her blush when they made awkward eye contact meant she knew that he knew. As Jacob talked with the client, Mark reached for his phone to text her “Go pee. It’s fine,” but stopped himself. Was that crossing a boundary or was he overthinking it?

Then the meeting ended. Normally one to summarize her notes, Izzy slammed her notebook shut and got up. Mark looked and a wave of arousal came roaring back. There was a wet spot on her pants. The conference room lighting wasn’t always the clearest, but on her light colored shorts, the stain really popped.

“Run Izzy, run!”

"PuddlePirate" might love to see his coworker have an accident, but "Mark" wasn’t so sure. Izzy took off down the hall and Mark followed at a safe distance. He turned expecting to hear the bathroom door shut behind her but the handle didn’t budge. The occupant said something inside and Izzy said she’d just find the other bathroom. For a second, Mark considered going to the breakroom and taking a route past the other bathroom back to his desk, but he opted not to. He’d wait till Izzy returned to her desk and see if she mentioned it or he could notice the stain.

He returned to his desk and scrolled through some files not retaining anything. Footsteps rounded the corner, but it was just Gemma who was apparently in the other bathroom. He continued to aimlessly scroll while waiting for Izzy when his phone buzzed. He rolled his eyes and picked up.

“Hey Stuart what can I help you with?”

Stuart gave a rambling response and Mark managed to point him in the right direction. Upon realizing he didn’t need to pull up any specific files, he headed out to the parking lot for fresh air. Once Stuart thanked him for his him, Mark called his apartment to check on a maintenance request since he was already on the phone. He’d just hung up when Izzy stepped outside.

“Hey Iz…”

The pair made horrified eye contact as Izzy’s pants were completely soaked and the poor woman reeked of piss. Mark felt his cock harden and prayed Izzy was too embarrassed to think about looking down there.

“Rough day at the office,” Izzy mumbled.

“Anyone else know?”

“Hopefully not.”

Mark put a hand on her shoulder and felt a protective desire that he didn’t even know he had. For as turned on as he’d been in the meeting, he wanted nothing more than to comfort Izzy and assure her everything was okay. To tell her that one accident wouldn’t be the end of the world. Even if it was one of the hottest things he had seen in his entire life. “Your secret’s safe with me.”

Gemma’s Day

The alarm went off and the woman claiming to be Gemma Wade vaulted out of bed to the tune of Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5”. The song played as she blended herself a protein shake and ran on the treadmill for fifteen minutes of cardio to kickstart her day. As she showered, Gemma let the excitement fully sink in. Moving across the country had been an ambitious plan, but here she was at Goldfinch Data. The company did nothing to move her apart from one crucial detail.

It was the place of employment for Mark Henderson, or as she knew him online, PuddlePirate. They'd been talking for years, including a fateful DM where he accidently sent her a screenshot that contained his real name in the corner. She’d barely even need to lie on her resume, keeping some real comp sci experience and then adding three years at a fictitious data firm that “closed down” resulting her need for a new job. She finished showering and checked her computer. PuddlePirate had replied to a few of her comments and his latest dm was witty as ever. Gemma dressed herself, imagining a scenario in which she pissed herself straight through her tight pencil skirt onto Mark’s lap. Maybe they’d eventually get a chance to stay late on a project and have some fun with the office to themselves. The possibilities were endless, Gemma realized as she combed her blonde locks and brushed her glistening teeth.

Yet for a split second, she saw hesitation in her smile. What if Mark didn’t like her? What if she confessed and he wanted nothing to do with her? That didn’t seem particularly likely as PuddlePirate wanted everything to do with WetCrystal. But what about the person behind the screen? Her concerns were valid, but “Gemma Wade” didn’t have concerns. She was a confident girlboss ready to take on the world and snag her pee loving boyfriend in the process. She filled up her timestamped gallon of water jug and drove to work. She let her showtunes finish before powering off her car.

7:45. Right on time.

Gemma walked inside and briefly introduced herself to various coworkers that she passed on the way to her desk. Some like Peter were middle aged with kids while others like Kara looked about her age. She took her seat and was eventually joined by a pretty Latina around her age. Gemma looked at the clock and grew worried. It was after eight with no sign of Mark. How stupid would she feel if she had gotten the job Mark vacated?

Her coworker set down her belongs, including a large iced coffee, and walked over. “Izzy Guerrero. I believe we’ll be working together quite a bit.”

“Nice to meet you, Izzy! How big is our team by chance?”

“Six. There’s us, our supervisor Jacob who probably interviewed you, Peter, Kara, and it looks like Mark just walked in now.”

“Mornin’!” Mark said as he walked over. Gemma waved and introduced herself to Mark while containing her fluttering heart. She'd found him on both LinkedIn and Facebook, but he looked even better in the flesh. Mark logged into his computer and Gemma had to turn to hide her devious smile. His screensaver was indeed the same Buccaneers banner as PuddlePirate’s YellowFlow profile. While far from a sports person, she asked a few questions about football to get the conversation flowing. Mark answered them and then moved onto some general small talk until Jacob arrived.

Jacob Pinter was a man around forty with a black beard who gave her a tour of the office before showing her where to access her training materials. “And I assume you can get through these pretty fast based on past experience.”

“Hopefully so. If I have any questions I’ll ask,” Gemma said.

Jacob headed to his office while Gemma looked around the open room she shared with Izzy and Mark. She heard the soft tapping of someone’s foot and saw Izzy fidget in her chair. Evidently the coffee had run its course, because she got up.

“What if I delay her?”

It was a simple thought, but a fun one. “Hey real quick. The bathroom is down that hall, right?” Gemma asked.

Izzy stopped abruptly. “Yep! There’s another ladies room on the other side of the floor but this is the one I always use,” Izzy said.

“Okay thanks. I forgot to ask about that on my tour,” Gemma lied.

Izzy rounded the corner and Gemma followed once she heard the door shut. It was a single stalled bathroom so she let herself imagine Izzy rushing to the toilet. Had her little delay caused any complications? Probably not, right?

Izzy opened the door and jumped back a little. “Sorry, did not mean to scare you,” Gemma laughed.

“You’re fine! I probably should’ve expected it when you asked where the bathroom was.”

“Well I appreciate the answer. Would not be fun to figure out in a pinch,” Gemma said. She returned to her desk and Jacob came back by with an interesting tidbit of information. There was a meeting at 10:30. She didn’t want to push her luck, but perhaps next Monday she could beat Izzy to the bathroom before that meeting and prevent her from going. No one would suspect the new hire of anything nefarious, right?

Gemma half assed the training while watching Izzy from the corner of her eye. She was sitting on her foot within the hour and clearly going to pee before the meeting. Then she got a phone call just after ten that kept going. Gemma watched the clock like a hawk while Izzy's window to pee continued to narrow. Jacob walked to the conference room and Gemma realized she could leverage his absence for a poorly timed favor. Izzy would surely turn her down, but it was worth a shot.

“Hey Izzy, can you help me find a program?” Gemma asked.

“I’ve got a meeting soon, but I can help you find it if it’s quick.”

“Oh honey…”

“Oh right! I’ll make this fast,” Gemma said. She explained what training resources she was after and clicked the wrong folder a couple of times causing Izzy to make her back out. She found what she needed right at 10:29 and thanked her. Izzy couldn’t quite mask her disappoint as she headed off to her meeting without a bathroom break.

Gemma’s mind went wild as the minutes passed and she wished nothing more to be a fly on the conference room wall. Her gut said the meeting would be about an hour, so she waited 50 minutes then headed to the women’s bathroom.

“There’s no way this works, right?” Gemma thought as she let a stream pee flow through her panties, just enough to make them damp, but impossible for anyone else to notice.

Frantic footsteps headed down the hallway. Gemma knew who it was by how intensely she jiggled the handle.

“I’ll be out in a minute,” Gemma said, pretending to be startled.

“It’s okay, I just use the other one,” Izzy said.

“Fuck! There’s another bathroom,” Gemma remembered. Izzy raced down the hall and Gemma returned to her seat soon after. She braced herself to see what state Izzy would be in when she walked back over.

Ten minutes passed. Then fifteen. Mark got a phone call and Gemma awkwardly sat by herself pretending to look at training materials. Mark walked back inside and Gemma looked around. “Did Izzy go to lunch after the meeting?” she asked.

Mark’s frown told her all she needed to know, but his answer confirmed it. “She wasn’t feeling well so she went home.”

“Oh dang. Hope she feels better,” Gemma said.

“Yeah. Be back after lunch,” Mark said.

He left and Gemma crossed the office. Her heart pounded with each step as she found the women’s bathroom on the other side. When no one responded to her knock, she opened it with trembling hands.

She nearly gagged as the room had been blasted by air freshener, particularly around the trash can. Gemma walked over and dug in. It was full of paper towels that absolutely reeked of piss. “I made her have an accident.”

Gemma sat on the toilet and barely had to touch herself before having one of the best orgasms she could remember. It was a high like nothing she had experienced before.

And she couldn’t wait to do it again.

And I can't wait for her to do it again! I mean... hrm... oooh Gemma, you devilish woman, you! Don't you dare conspiring for another humiliating accident for your sexy colleague who may or may not be wearing a long tight pencil skirt the next time, like for instance, on a business trip to somewhere, taking advantage of a tight schedule, an oblivious driver, traffic-induced delays or bathroom-less shops along the way or something like that! That'd be absolutely awful to read about in great detail....!

Please do it again! Please do it again! Please do it again!

Oh no! Something like that happening to Izzy and co would be most unfortunate!

Tuesday

Izzy’s Day

For as much of a disaster as Izzy’s previous morning had been, she didn’t mind taking the afternoon to lick her wounds, knock out some overdue chores and treat herself to wine and ice cream that night. She wasn’t sure how she’d manage to look at Mark with a straight face, but at least he had been sympathetic. She awoke after her snooze alarm like usual and got ready. A quick Facebook scroll reminded her it was Kara’s birthday and she ran by the store to grab balloons and cupcakes on her way to work. The self-checkouts weren’t open yet and the old lady in front of her was a bit chatty, but after the disaster that was yesterday, she wasn’t in too much of a rush. She reached work just as Jason Mraz’s “Waterfalls” was ending.

8:02. Close enough.

Izzy headed inside with the balloons and cupcakes. She set the cupcakes in the breakroom and found Kara’s desk. “Hey birthday girl!”

Kara smiled. She had more makeup than usual and her black hair curls had been straightened. “Thanks Iz! Hope you’re feeling better.”

“I am. My stomach just wasn’t agreeing with me yesterday but I feel fine,” she lied.

“Good! Want to get drinks tonight at Soto’s?”

“Sure that’d be fun!” Izzy said. She turned at the sound of footsteps as Gemma walked by with a fresh mug of coffee.

“Good morning guys! I saw the cupcakes in the breakroom and was wondering whose birthday it was,” Gemma said.

“It’s mine! I’m 29, so one more year until I’m old,” Kara joked.

“30 isn’t old,” Gemma said. “Doing anything fun?”

“Izzy and I were going to Soto’s tonight. If you want to get to know people better, feel free to join,” Kara offered.

“Sure, might as well!” Gemma said.

Izzy headed back to her room with Gemma and they took their seats. Gemma had a few questions about some of the training materials and Izzy answered them before catching up on emails. Between Terracorp and Stuart’s company, Rinaldi Enterpises, those two big clients kept plenty of work and another potential client had emailed just before five the day before. She typed a response as Mark walked in. He logged in and made the rounds before getting to work.

Izzy got a text, from Mark despite sitting about ten feet from each other.

Mark: You going out for drinks? (Not sure if Kara invited Gemma cause she’s so new)

Izzy: I am! Gemma’s coming too 😊

Mark: Fun!

After her disastrous Monday, Tuesday turned out to be blissfully normal. She knocked out several reports and took a phone call from Danielle, a geologist for an energy company in town. She set up a meeting for herself and Mark when Jacob walked over.

“I think this meeting with Titan would be a perfect first project for Gemma to sit in on,” he said.

“I agree. Danielle’s definitely one of our easier clients,” Izzy said.

“I’d love to meet clients already,” Gemma said.

“Perfect. Just tell Mark to try to be a good influence on her,” Jacob said.

Mark grinned. “I make no promises!”

After a relatively uneventful afternoon, Izzy shut down her computer as Kara walked over. “Ready for tonight?” Kara asked.

“It’ll be so much fun. I can pick you up at around 6:30 if that works,” Izzy said.

Kara high fived her. “Perfect! See you then.”

Izzy got ready to leave when Gemma stopped. “Hey Izzy?”

“Yes?” Izzy asked. Gemma looked a little nervous for some reason.

Gemma toyed with a strand of blonde hair. “Hey um, would it be possible if you could pick me up too? Normally I know my tolerance but it being late in an unfamiliar town I don’t really want to take any chances.”

“That should work. You live pretty close by, right?”

Gemma nodded and gave her address, which turned out to be only five minutes from Kara’s. Happy to help another coworker out, she said bye to Mark while looking forward to getting to know Gemma a little better.

After a quick stop at her apartment to feed her cat and get ready, Izzy found herself in front of the mirror. She’d changed into a green dress which fit her form nicely while being her favorite color. “I’ll look great for Mark.”

Izzy froze and dropped her makeup brush as that thought intrusively crept in. He was a fun little work crush and nothing more. Yet something about the way he was there to comfort her after the accident just wouldn’t go away. Was there more?

“That’s future Izzy’s problem. All I care about tonight is making sure Kara has a great birthday,” Izzy reasoned.

She left her apartment and made her way to Gemma’s. She knocked on the door and her coworker came out a few minutes later. Her blonde hair was in a bun and she had a short blue dress with matching earrings and a silver ring on her finger.

“Pretty ring. Have I missed you wearing a wedding ring?” Izzy asked.

“If only,” Gemma laughed. “It was my grandmother’s and I haven’t worn it in a while. Allegedly she wore it the night she met my grandfather, so you never know. History might repeat itself!”

“Maybe it will,” Izzy said. “This is a fun place, so you could end up meeting someone.”

They made a quick trip to Kara’s where Gemma got in the back to give the birthday girl the honors of shotgun. Purple was a good color on Kara and as they drove, Izzy envisioned a world where the three of them became “real” friends rather than strictly “work” friends. Goldfinch was a nice enough office job, but she still had hoped to have made a few more friends in town.

They parked at Soto’s and headed inside. The restaurant wasn’t too crowded on a Tuesday, which Izzy certainly didn’t mind. They had unfortunately missed “Margarita Monday” but the drinks still weren’t that pricey, even with her planning to get Kara’s tab. The trio treated themselves to chips and salsa while Mark predictably sent a “running late” text. Punctuality wasn’t exactly his strong suit.

Eventually Mark arrived wearing an open flannel over a white tee. Izzy waved while she was mentally taken back to the parking lot after her accident. Not only was he unbothered, he hadn’t told a soul. The one friend she was willing to share her horrible Monday with had sent back two words to describe him. “Boyfriend material.” The fact she felt genuinely disappointed when she realized the seating arrangement left him across from Gemma wasn’t helping her nerves.

Izzy managed to calm herself down and the birthday dinner was a nice time. After they’d each had a margarita with their food, Gemma excused herself to the bathroom and agreed to meet them out back for some yard games. She gave Kara her card to buy a second marg leaving her alone on the porch with Mark. The pair stood their in awkward silence before each fumbling the beginning of an attempted conversation and laughing it off.

“Thanks for yesterday. I owe you,” Izzy finally managed.

“Oh it was no big deal. Like, I’m sure it was super embarrassing, but it’ll make a funny story once enough time passes,” Mark said.

“I hope so,” Izzy admitted. “Let me at least buy you a beer.”

Mark smiled. “Always down for a Corona.”

They returned from the bar to find Gemma and Kara setting up a game of washers. Each had a new marg on a table. Mark asked Kara if she was feeling it and she laughed it off.

“I can call in sick tomorrow if needed,” Kara said half jokingly.

“Fair enough. The three of us have a meeting tomorrow so we have to behave ourselves,” Gemma said with a hearty sip.

“I thought Mark was supposed to be a good influence on you,” Kara said.

“I never said I was good at that role. Izzy’s the goody two shoes around here," Mark said.

“I am not a goody two shoes,” Izzy protested.

“Really now?” Kara laughed.

“I’ve done… things! I once snuck out to go drinking in high school,” Izzy said.

“Easy guys we’ve got a rebel here,” Gemma laughed. She then handed some washers to Mark. “You can start being a good influence by teaching me how to play washers.”

“Bet,” Mark said. “The goody two shoes and birthday girl are going down!”

Kara flipped him and Gemma the double birds while scooping up her set of washers. Her first toss was wildly off target and the subsequent ones weren’t much better. Mark scored once, but also had a rough outing. They switched to the other partners where Izzy unexpectedly drilled two perfect shots to start her round.

“I’ll drink to that!” Kara declared.

Izzy took a sip of beer as well. Her bladder was starting to fill, but for all the “goody two shoes” allegations, she had enough experience to know this was a night to wait and break the seal later. The game turned out close in the end. Despite her side comments to Izzy about also trying to avoid peeing, one and a half margaritas had Kara desperate for the bathroom after the first game of washers.

“I’ll go again for good luck,” Gemma laughed. Based on the giant time-stamped water bottle she brought to work, Izzy had a hunch that like herself, Gemma also had to pee a lot.

“What a weird thing to be thinking about,” Izzy laughed to herself.

While the other two were gone, Izzy and Mark decided to be teammates for the second game and got some extra practice in. Kara returned a few minutes later while Gemma eventually headed back out with a basket of chips and queso.

The second game was a blowout, as Mark and Izzy were too much for the others to handle. Gemma and Kara demanded a rematch, and while they lost, it was at least competitive. With a bit more time till closing, Izzy and Gemma took on Mark and Kara to complete all the possible team combos.

By the fourth game’s end, Izzy’s bladder decided it couldn’t wait and she needed to pee before they left. Kara had just agreed to go with her when Gemma gasped.

"Oh shit!"

“Gemma, is everything alright?” Izzy asked.

Gemma shook her head. “I can’t find my ring! I took it off to help with weight distribution and it's gone. I hope it’s not it the grass.”

“On it,” Mark said. He hit the flashlight app on his phone while the others did likewise. They scanned the ground for a bit without luck before Gemma remembered they had moved the boards to find more even ground after the first game. They retraced their steps and Gemma found it right at closing time.

“Thank goodness! It was my grandmother’s,” Gemma said.

“Well I’m glad we found it,” Kara said. “I was going to pee again but I think we’re getting kicked out.”

“Looks like it,” Izzy said. “I was going to go to but I can wait.”

“There’s always the Valero around the corner if needed,” Mark said. “See you guys at work tomorrow, unless Kara just so happens to be sick.”

“I’ll be a good noodle,” Kara laughed as she followed Izzy to her car. Izzy opened the door and warning lights came on as soon as it turned on. Tire pressure.

“Oh no!” Izzy gasped. Not only did she have to pee, she knew admittedly nothing about cars. She, Gemma, and Kara checked all four tires before discovering one of the back ones had a nail in it.

“Why is there a nail in a restaurant parking lot?” Kara complained. “Fuck, I have to piss like a racehorse.”

“You can see if they’ll let you back in,” Izzy offered.

“It’s fine. I worked at restaurant in high school and don’t want to be ‘that customer’. Let’s just get this changed fast. We can call Mark if needed,” Kara said.

“I’ll do that,” Izzy said. She called Mark while Kara and Gemma retrieved the spare and jack from the trunk. Kara was bobbing up and down while Gemma struggled to loosen the lugnuts.

“Does it turn this way or that way?” Gemma asked.

“It’s got to be righty tighty lefty loosy,” Kara said.

Mark picked up immediately and said he’d turn back around. Soon he found them in the parking lot and took over with some additional help from Gemma. “Oh man, that nail is really in there. The first thing to do is…”

In the light of their phones, Izzy’s jaw dropped at a hauntingly familiar sight. A spurt of pee rolled down Kara’s leg and based on awkward expressions, everyone saw it too.

“Kara are you okay?” Gemma asked.

“I’m literally about to piss myself!”

Mark unlocked his car. “We’ll come back to this. Bathroom break time!”

Kara ran in the passenger seat while Izzy and Gemma crammed into the back row. “I’ll try to hold on,” Kara said. “It just came out of nowhere and…”

“It’s fine. Honestly I need to go too,” Mark said.

“Same,” Izzy and Gemma admitted.

“It’s a uh… team building exercise,” Kara said. “Shit! Another leak. Mark I am so sorry!”

“Hang on. Almost there,” Mark said. He pulled into the gas station a little rough and Izzy felt her own bladder leak as they hit the curb. He swung into the closet empty parking spot when the floodgates opened for Kara.

Kara lasted just two steps out of the car before her purple dress began to darken. She took a few more steps before succumbing to the inevitable. “No. Please no! Not on my fucking birthday!”

“Um uh… spread your feet to minimize the damage!” Mark suggested.

“I thought I could hold it,” Kara stammered. “This is so…”

“It’s okay,” Izzy said. “But I will be right back, or else I’ll join you.”

Izzy ran inside with Gemma close behind. She found the door and threw it open. It was only single stalled women’s bathroom, and behind her she heard Gemma say “Fuck it” before running in to the men’s. She yanked her increasingly saturated white panties down and peed full force into the toilet. She had avoided a second accident in as many days, but had come way closer than she wanted to admit. She washed her hands and came out to Mark and Gemma laughing as the latter left the men’s room. Izzy headed back outside and found Kara sitting a parking space’s barrier, which had a noticeable wet spot once she stood up.

“This is so embarrassing,” Kara said. Izzy gave her hug, and Kara managed a slight smile. “But also a little funny. Just sucks that it happened on my birthday.”

“Hey, if this is 29, at least 30 is sure to end on a better note next year,” Gemma said.

“So true, Gemma,” Kara laughed. “I think Jacob hired another good one.”

Mark returned and they headed back to Soto’s. He finished changing the tire and wished them a good night.

“Thanks for the help,” Izzy said. She considered hugging him, but chickened out.

Kara raised an inquisitive eyebrow but didn’t acknowledge it. “Sorry in advance about the seat.”

“I can clean it tomorrow,” Izzy said. They rode in silence till they hit a red light and she got an idea. “Um Kara, I’ve got a confession.”

“I’m all ears.”

Izzy felt her face redden but it was too late to stop now. “I didn’t actually get sick yesterday. I peed my pants.”

Kara’s jaw dropped. “You did not!”

“I drank too much and couldn’t pee before my big meeting with TerraCorp. I totally soaked myself.”

“Oh no!” Gemma gasped. “I was in the bathroom after the meeting and didn’t realize!”

Izzy sighed. “It’s not your fault. But uh, you might want to make sure to pee before our meeting with Titan tomorrow.”

“For sure,” Gemma laughed. “I’m learning from the best around here.”

Mark’s Day

Mark’s Monday afternoon had him in an absolute daze as he still struggled to process that Izzy’s accident had actually happened. Yet every time he looked over at the empty chair, he was mentally taken back to the parking lot. Once he got home, acted on those thoughts multiple times throughout the night. In between orgasms, he felt conflicted, but at least he had seemingly kept his cool and said the right thing in the moment. He hated that his first witnessed accident as an adult was at Izzy's expense, but he wasn’t going to act like the aftermath wasn’t one of the hottest things he’d seen either.

He woke up before his alarm and started writing up an account of Izzy’s accident on YellowFlow before backpedaling after it felt wrong. Instead he simply opened a DM to get the sighting off his chest.

PuddlePirate: OMG. One of my coworkers had an accident yesterday. I feel really bad because she’s super nice, but damn it was hot.

He took a shower and found a DM was waiting when he got back.

WetCrystal: Congrats on finally getting a sighting in the wild! But yeah, sucks that it was someone you know.

PuddlePirate: Yeah. I nearly wrote up a whole post, but it just felt wrong at her expense.

WetCrystal: Totally get it. Maybe we can roleplay it out sometime 😊

PuddlePirate: Don’t threaten me with a good time.

They made a few plans for their next roleplay session before Mark realized he was once again running late for work. Still, he stayed in the car an extra minute to finish “November Rain” and checked the time.

8:08. Close enough.

Mark headed inside and noticed cupcakes in the breakroom. After a quick walk around he found Kara sitting at her desk with straightened hair and new makeup. Kara was stunning as usual, but Izzy had always been more of his type.

“Good morning, birthday girl!”

“Thanks Mark,” Kara said. “One more year till the big 3-0 so I’m enjoying being young.”

“Oh I doubt it’s that different,” Mark said.

“If you’re down, I was thinking about getting a group to go to Soto’s tonight,” Kara offered.

“Sure!” Mark said. He hadn’t been in a few months and in general he was still trying to make more friends as an adult. He shot a text to Izzy once it sat down to ask if she was going and Izzy replied that both she and Gemma were.

The rest of the workday was mundane aside from Jacob granting Gemma permission to meet Danielle alongside himself and Izzy.

“Just try to be a good influence on her,” Jacob said.

Mark grinned. “I make no promises!”

After going home and overthinking on what to wear, he went with a simple flannel. The girls would presumably be wearing dresses and he needed something at least a step up from a t-shirt. He started down the stairs before turning back and swapping his jeans for khakis. He arrived later than intended and joined Izzy, Kara, and Gemma for dinner. As Gemma was the first one to break her seal, Mark found himself wondering if her bladder was even smaller than Izzy’s. At the very least, her water jug meant she was hydrated, potentially to a fault. What if she ended up in a similar scenario to Izzy?

He shook those thoughts off as Kara bought a drink leaving him alone with Izzy. He wasn’t sure where to take the conversation, but Izzy eventually referenced the elephant in the room after they each stumbled over their words.

“Thanks for yesterday. I owe you,” Izzy said.

“Oh it was no big deal. Like, I’m sure it was super embarrassing, but it’ll make a funny story once enough time passes,” Mark said.

“I hope so,” Izzy said. She was blushing faintly, and damn she was cute. “Let me at least buy you a beer.”

“Always down for a Corona,” Mark said. He felt himself blush a bit too. Was there more between them?

They returned from the bar to find Gemma and Kara setting up a game of washers. Each had a new marg on a table. Mark asked Kara if she was feeling it and she laughed it off.

“I can call in sick tomorrow if needed,” Kara laughed.

“Fair enough. The three of us have a meeting tomorrow so we have to behave ourselves,” Gemma said with a hearty sip.

The four of them spent the next few minutes poking fun at each other, particularly Izzy as Kara told Mark to be a good influence on Gemma and he insinuated Izzy was a goody two shoes. Once they finishing teasing her, Gemma handed him some washers.

"You can start being a good influence by teaching me how to play washers.”

“Bet,” Mark said. “The goody two shoes and birthday girl are going down.”

He and Gemma fought valiantly, but came up just short. While the game was fun, he noticed all three women getting a bit restless. His drinks were starting to catch up to him as well, but he resolved to put that off as long as possible. After the first game, Kara was unable to hide her desperation and Gemma left with her as well. He debated teasing her for already having to go a second time, but opted against it. Maybe he’d test it as a bit if Gemma continued to pee that often while at work.

He and Izzy took turns practicing and absolutely smoked their competition before winning again in a closer rematch. In between tosses, he sipped his beer and ate some of the chips and queso Gemma bought the group. By the start of the last game, all four of them had finished two drinks each—two margs for Kara and Gemma, and a marg and a beer for himself and Izzy. A bathroom trip was presumably in order before they left. They finished the last game and he noticed Izzy and Kara start walking inside.

“Oh shit!” Gemma gasped.

Mark turned and for a second he wondered if somehow was about to witness another accident, but instead Gemma was looking for her ring. The four of them scoured the grass until closing time when Gemma found it at the last minute. Mark could’ve sworn he saw her pull it from her purse when Kara and Izzy looked away, but he didn’t say anything. She probably just felt embarrassed once she realized it was in her purse all along.

“Thank goodness! It was my grandmother’s,” Gemma said.

“Well I’m glad we found it,” Kara said. “I was going to pee again but I think we’re getting kicked out.”

“Looks like it,” Izzy said. “I was going to go to, but I can wait.”

“There’s always the Valero around the corner if needed,” Mark said. “See you guys at work tomorrow, unless Kara just so happens to be sick.”

“I’ll be a good noodle,” Kara laughed.

Mark waved goodbye and headed to his car. He was a bit disappointed to miss desperate Izzy and Kara, but he opted to leave that his imagination.

…for about two minutes.

Izzy called and he picked up. “Hello?”

“Hey Mark. Um… I have a flat tire. Could you help?”

“Of course! Be right there,” Mark said.

He turned back around, with a hunch his evening had gotten a bit more interesting. Izzy, Kara, and Gemma crowded around the car, which apparently had run over a nail. While Izzy and Gemma were squirming, Kara was on another level after two margaritas and breaking the seal. Mark tried to work as fast as possible, but she was struggling. The he saw her start leaking.

“Kara are you okay?” Gemma asked.

“I’m literally about to piss myself!”

“No way this happens again, right?”

Mark unlocked his car. “We’ll come back to this. Bathroom break time!”

Kara ran into the passenger seat while Izzy and Gemma crammed into the back row. “I’ll try to hold on,” Kara said. “It just came out of nowhere and…”

“It’s fine. Honestly, I need to go too,” Mark said. He wasn’t close to accident territory, but it certainly wasn’t a lie either.

“Same,” Izzy and Gemma admitted.

“It’s a uh… team building exercise,” Kara said. “Shit! Another leak. Mark I am so sorry!”

“Hang on. Almost there,” Mark said. He pulled into the gas station a little rough and swore as he hit the curb. He swung into the closet empty parking spot when the floodgates opened for Kara. She ran out of the car and lasted just two steps out of the car before her purple dress began to darken. She took a few more steps before succumbing to the inevitable. “No. Please no! Not on my fucking birthday!”

“Two in two days? What is my life right now???”

“Um uh… spread your feet to minimize the damage!” Mark suggested based on his experience reading YellowFlow fics.

Kara did just that. “I thought I could hold it. This is so…”

“It’s okay,” Izzy said. “But I will be right back, or else I’ll join you.”

Izzy and Gemma ran inside. Mark headed that way, but looked back to Kara. “I’m so, so, sorry.”

“Hey you came close to saving me,” Kara said. “I’ll be fine. Go pee in the toilet like an adult.”

For a split second, he fixated on the thought of Kara wearing diapers before heading inside. Both bathrooms were in use and when the door to the men’s room opened, he and Gemma laughed at the absurdity of the situation after some awkward eye contact.

He took care of business and headed back to his car. Kara apologized again and he told her not to worry. He’d clean the seat eventually. He finished changing the tire and Izzy thanked again before wishing him a goodnight. He could’ve sworn something was in the air between them, but perhaps that was his imagination.

He headed back home and found himself wondering if he would even tell Crystal. There was no way she’d believe two accidents in two days, right?She did message a few hours later asking about roleplaying details, including the character’s name. Mark gave the first name that popped in his head while figuring out what details he’d alter from the real accident. Why stop at witnessing two accidents a week, when he could roleplay a third?

Gemma’s Day

After anxiously monitoring her YellowFlow inbox the night before, Gemma awoke to the message she’d been hoping for. PuddlePirate’s poor coworker had had an accident and he predictably had to tell WetCrystal about it. They messaged a few times over the course of the morning, but PuddlePirate appeared reluctant to share personal details about the accident. It was good he respected Izzy’s privacy and even better once he accepted her offer to roleplay later. As true switch, being comforted by Mark sounded just as tantalizing as making Izzy lose control.

Over the course of her morning cardio, protein shake, and messaging Mark, Gemma admittedly lost track of time. Rather than arriving fifteen minutes early like usual, she checked the time as she pulled into her parking spot and shut off the car after the second chorus of “Cry Me A River”.

7:52. Close enough.

Gemma flipped on the lights of her room and reopened the various training modules she had half-heartedly worked on when not ruminating on Izzy’s accident. It looked to be a pretty easy job all things considered. Unlike like the rush she felt the day before, she decided it would be a fairly nondescript Tuesday. She couldn’t have Mark getting too suspicious after all.

Then Izzy arrived and wished Kara a happy birthday. She highly doubted that Izzy thought anything malicious of her, but getting on her good side still felt like a smart move. She heard them mention drinks on her walk over and suddenly the gears started turning again.

Gemma walked over to Kara’s desk after grabbing coffee. “Good morning guys! I saw the cupcakes in the breakroom and was wondering whose birthday it was.”

“It’s mine! I’m 29 so one more year until I’m old,” Kara joked.

“30 isn’t old,” Gemma said. Then she took her shot. “Doing anything fun?”

“Izzy and I were going to Soto’s tonight. If you want to get to know people better, feel free to join,” Kara offered.

“Sure, might as well!” Gemma said. She was officially in.

The day itself was uneventful aside from Jacob letting her join Izzy and Mark for a meeting with one of their clients the next day. Before she knew it, the day was almost over. She’d made a few drafts of her next plan and opted to press her luck as Izzy offered to pick up Kara.

She channeled her best nervous new hire energy and approached Izzy. “Hey um, would it be possible if you could pick me up too? Normally I know my tolerance but it being late in an unfamiliar town I don’t really want to take any chances.”

“That should work. You live pretty close by, right?” Izzy asked.

Gemma nodded and gave her address. Izzy told her she’d pick her up at 6:25 and left the office. She drove home and finalized the next steps of her plan. Simply delaying Izzy’s bathroom trip had worked wonders and she now had two potential victims. She contemplated how to achieve that when her eyes found her grandmother’s ring. That might help, but she needed something else similar to the client’s phone call that worked against Izzy. She opened her closet for ideas before finding her toolbox.

“Perfect.”

She changed into a blue dress and did her hair, finishing just before Izzy arrived. She looked good in her green dress, though a wet spot would definitely complete the image. She had similar thoughts about Kara’s purple dress.

The three of them got a table and she let Kara sit down across from Izzy to secure her coveted spot across from Mark. She knew how turned on he’d been by Izzy’s accident. If only she could tell him it was her perfect orchestration…

It wasn’t the time for that though. Mark arrived and the four of them enjoyed their food and drinks. She slipped out to “pee” and was relieved that no one else had to go. She bypassed the bathroom and headed back to the parking lot. Izzy’s car sat a few spots away from the other vehicles. She pulled the nail from her purse when another car parked next to Izzy’s.

“And yeah. It’s just like sometimes Kyle doesn’t seem to be trying,” Gemma said while faking a phone call. The couple who'd arrived walked in but before she could puncture the tire, a truck with four frat guys from Goldwood College arrived.

“Screw this. Too many people arriving,” Gemma realized.

She ordered a second margarita from the bar and found Kara outside securing a set of washers. Gemma helped her set up as Mark and Izzy came back with beers. For a moment she wondered if creating the opportunity for them to spend time together was mistake, but she pushed it aside. Mark had known Izzy for years. If he wanted her, he would’ve made the move.

She handed a set of washers to Mark as they partnered up for the first game. “You’re mine, PuddlePirate.”

As they played, Gemma couldn’t help notice Kara getting desperate. Two margs seemed to be wrecking her bladder and she unsurprisingly had to pee after the first game. Gemma followed her to the bathroom and went herself. For as much as she loved watching others wet, her own bladder was admittedly small, a fact not helped by her excessive hydration routine. She made sure to leave after Kara and was grateful they didn’t know each other well enough for her to wait and make small talk on the way back.

Gemma returned to the parking lot. Night had fallen and people were starting to leave. She watched a group of friends head out while faking another phone call. Once the car closest to her was gone, she found Izzy’s Rav 4.

“Nothing personal, Izzy,” Gemma thought as she jammed the nail into one of the rear tires.

She bought chips and queso to alleviate questions about her absence and lost two games against Izzy and Mark alongside Kara. Being a Tuesday, Soto’s closed at 9, but there was just enough time for one more game. Neither Izzy nor Kara got up to use the bathroom and she felt confident the odds of her plan working had shot up considerably. When no one was looking, she took off her ring and slipped it in her purse.

The last game was admittedly a fun one. For moment, she found herself wondering if Izzy and Kara could be genuine friends once she and Mark started dating, but then the game ended and it was back to business.

Izzy and Kara started to head to the bathroom, but Gemma couldn’t allow that to happen. “Oh shit!”

“What is it?” Mark asked.

She frantically looked around for her “missing ring” which made Izzy and Kara abandon their bathroom trip. The time inched closer to 9:00 and at 8:59, she pulled the ring from her purse when no one was looking.

“Thank goodness! It was my grandmother’s,” Gemma said.

“Well I’m glad we found it,” Kara said. “I was going to pee again but I think we’re getting kicked out.”

“Looks like it,” Izzy said. “I was going to go to, but I can wait.”

“There’s always the Valero around the corner if needed,” Mark said. “See you guys at work tomorrow, unless Kara just so happens to be sick.”

“I’ll be a good noodle,” Kara laughed.

Mark bid them a goodnight as Gemma, Izzy, and Kara headed to the other car. Izzy started the car without checking her tires and was immediately hit by the tire pressure warning.

“Oh no!” Izzy gasped.

The three of them got out to check the tires and Gemma let Kara find the nail.

“Why is there a nail in a restaurant parking lot?” Kara complained. “Fuck, I have to piss like a racehorse.”

“You can see if they’ll let you back in,” Izzy offered.

For a moment, Gemma wondered if something that simple would undo her plan, but Kara blindly worked against her best interest.

“It’s fine. I worked at restaurant in high school and don’t want to be ‘that customer’. Let’s just get this changed fast. We can call Mark if needed,” Kara said.

“I’ll do that,” Izzy said.

While Izzy called Mark, Gemma helped Kara pull out the spare tire and jack while doing her best to subtly slow them down. She intentionally tried to turn the wrench the wrong way and groaned. “Does it turn this way or that way?”

“It’s got to be righty tighty lefty loosy,” Kara said.

Soon Mark arrived on the scene and looked at the tire. “Oh man, that nail is really in there.” He gave instructions and Gemma worked on her tasks slowly, at least to the extent a girl who presumably knew nothing about cars could reasonably do without coming across as stupid.

Then she saw Kara tense up. Pee leaked down her leg.

Gemma’s heart pounded. “It’s happening again.” “Kara are you okay?”

“I’m literally about to piss myself!”

Mark unlocked his car. “We’ll come back to this. Bathroom break time!”

Kara ran in the passenger seat while Gemma crammed into the back row with Izzy. “I’ll try to hold on,” Kara said. “It just came out of nowhere and…”

“It’s fine. Honestly I need to go too,” Mark said.

“I guess even the Puddle Pirate isn’t invincible.”

She then said “Same” along with Izzy, which was certainly true. What fun was engineering these accidents without a little risk herself.

“It’s a uh… team building exercise,” Kara said. “Shit! Another leak. Mark I am so sorry!”

“Hang on. Almost there,” Mark said. He pulled into the gas station a little rough and Gemma felt her own bladder leak as they hit the curb. He swung into the closet empty parking spot when the floodgates opened for Kara.

Kara lasted just two steps out of the car before her purple dress began to darken. She took a few more steps before succumbing to the inevitable. “No. Please no! Not on my fucking birthday!”

Gemma got out of the car and admired her handiwork. Pee gushed out of Kara and soaked the crotch of her purple dress before pooling underneath her. A part of her felt bad, but that emotion paled in comparison to her own arousal. She looked over at Izzy to see if she had somehow manifested a double wetting, but she held on.

“Um uh… spread your feet to minimize the damage!” Mark suggested.

“I thought I could hold it,” Kara stammered. “This is so…”

“It’s okay,” Izzy said. “But I will be right back, or else I’ll join you.”

Gemma said nothing, but ran in after Izzy. She wanted to beat her to the ladies room, but her coworker had too much of a head start. She lost another spurt as she ran and said “Fuck it” before throwing open the door to the men’s room.

She threw herself onto the toilet pulled her panties down. For as much as she wanted to piss straight through them, Mark already had one seat to clean. She debated masturbating until she heard footsteps and remembered that she was in the men’s.

She walked out and made awkward eye contact with Mark. In perhaps the most intimate “irl” moment between them, they burst out laughing at the absurdity of the situation.

Outside she found Kara sitting on a parking space’s barrier, which had a noticeable wet spot after she stood up.

“This is so embarrassing,” Kara said as Izzy hugged her. “But also a little funny,” she added with a slight smile. “Just sucks that it happened on my birthday.”

“Hey, if this is 29, at least 30 is sure to end on a better note next year,” Gemma said.

“So true, Gemma,” Kara laughed. “I think Jacob hired another good one.”

Gemma beamed at the compliment. Her infiltration of the group was off to an even better start that she expected.

Mark returned and they headed back to Soto’s. He finished changing the tire and wished them a good night.

“Sorry in advance about the seat,” Kara said as Gemma climbed in behind her.

“I can clean it tomorrow,” Izzy said. They rode in silence till they hit a red light. “Um Kara, I’ve got a confession.”

“I’m all ears.”

Gemma felt another adrenaline rush as she realized what was coming.

“I didn’t actually get sick yesterday. I peed my pants.”

Kara gasped. “You did not!”

“I drank too much and couldn’t pee before my big meeting with TerraCorp. I totally soaked myself.”

“My turn.”

“Oh no! I was in the bathroom after the meeting and didn’t realize!” Gemma lied.

Izzy sighed. “It’s not your fault. But uh, you might want to make sure to pee before our meeting with Titan tomorrow.”

“For sure,” Gemma laughed. “I’m learning from the best around here.”

Finally, Izzy dropped her off and wished her a goodnight. Gemma headed inside and wasted no time pleasuring herself as she relived Kara’s accident. An hour later, she had to pee and sat in her bathtub. She then pissed straight through her dress and peeled the soaked clothes off her before masturbating again. Once the euphoria faded, she showered and sat back at her desk wrapped in a towel.

PuddlePirate hadn’t said anything about his night, so WetCrystal opted to push her luck. Seeing the last message about roleplaying, Gemma picked up where they left off.

WetCrystal: Hey just trying to get into character for our next session. Obviously we shouldn’t use her real name, but what name should I use?

The message sat their for a few minutes before some typing bubbles appeared.

PuddlePirate: How about Gemma?

Gemma threw back her head and laughed. She was officially in his head. Her master plan was underway.

A/N: Thanks so much for all the lovely comments after part 1! I've wanted to try this story structure for quite some time and while I was a bit worried about certain parts being repetitive, it looks like it was a hit. Hope you liked this one too 🙂

Wednesday

Izzy’s Day

Izzy’s alarm went off and she found herself snuggling Felix for two snooze cycles instead of her usual one. It went off again and she sat up in bed while ruffling her tabby’s fur. “It’s going to be a nice and normal day this time,” she said as if Felix knew anything about either wetting accident that week. She took a shower and put on her favorite black dress for meeting clients. It was shaping up to be a routine workday, with a 3:00 meeting at Titan as the only major engagement. She grabbed a bagel from her pantry and headed to work while enjoying her 2010s throwback playlist. She parked and sat a bit longer to enjoy the last chorus of Kelly Clarkson’s “Stronger” before heading inside.

7:55. A nice and normal day.

Izzy walked in and immediately regretted forgetting to bring a pair of flats as her heels hurt. She poured herself some coffee and spread cream cheese on her bagel opting to cut down on her bathroom trips to walk as little as possible. She walked to her room of the office where usurpingly, Gemma was already there and Mark was running late. She waved to Gemma, who looked around before whispering.

“Have you heard from Kara?”

“I think she’ll be fine. Shortly after getting home she texted ‘Best shower of my life’.”

Gemma took a sip of coffee and looked relieved. “I’m glad. She seems super fun and I hate that happened on her birthday.”

“She’ll bounce back and probably tell this story at the Christmas party after a few glasses of wine,” Izzy assured her.

“Hopefully so.” Gemma clicked on a few files on her computer, but turned back around. “I guess I also should’ve asked. How are you? I know you said don’t worry about it, but I do feel awful about Monday.”

“Like I said, just a crazy string of coincidences,” Izzy said.

“Morning guys,” Mark said.

Izzy blushed. She hadn’t heard him walk in, but thankfully he appeared to be in good spirits about the conversation at hand. “Alright Gemma. Izzy and Kara had their turn. Which one of us is taking one for the team?”

Gemma laughed. “Hopefully neither.”

“Definitely neither. This is our nice and normal day,” Izzy told them.

The three of them got to work and her wishes for the morning came true. Izzy sent off emails, helped Gemma answer a few questions on her training and entertained Stuart Rinaldi for another rambling call. She hung up the phone and headed to the bathroom. She walked out and smiled at Gemma waiting outside.

“Our bodies must be in sync today,” Gemma laughed.

It was a funny thing to think about as both had gone around nine and then again around 10:30. For all of Izzy’s wishes about cutting back on bathroom breaks, she ended up going every 1-2 hours like usual, often with Gemma close behind. “Does drinking that much water ever get easier?” Izzy asked once Gemma sat back down a little after 1:00.

“Oh it kind of just depends on the day. Somedays I’m super thirsty other days I get behind and chug it before bed,” Gemma laughed.

“Not to judge, but that doesn’t sound like the best idea,” Mark said.

“Oh it’s not. I woke up to pee three times one night,” Gemma said.

“Just be careful then. The way things are going at Goldfinch this week you might not wake up in time,” Mark said.

Gemma looked down at her jug and sighed. “You just spoke that into existence didn’t you?”

“Nope! This is our nice and normal Wednesday. We’re not speaking anything into existence.

Then Izzy’s phone rang.

“That phone call is about to screw everything up isn’t it?” Mark asked.

“Probably,” Izzy said.

She took the call. “Hey Danielle!”

“Hey Isabella. Is it alright if we push the meeting up to 2:30 instead of 3? We had a scheduling mix up and I have another quick call I need to take at 4:30.”

“Yeah that’s totally fine. This was the main thing we have going on this afternoon here at Goldfinch,” Izzy said.

“Great! See you then.” Danielle hung up and Izzy relayed the news to Mark and Gemma. Neither of them had an issue with the schedule change and after a precautionary pee at 2:10, Izzy was ready to drive across town. Mark returned from the men’s room, but interestingly enough, Gemma opted not to go.

Mark drove them and had good stoplight luck, pulling into Titan’s parking lot at 2:20. They walked in and waved to Tamara, the secretary who knew them well enough.

“Hey Tamara. We’re here to meet Danielle,” Mark said.

“Perfect. There’s an interview wrapping up in the conference room so feel free to make yourselves some coffee or get water,” Tamara said.

They thanked her and headed to the breakroom. Izzy fired up the Keurig as Danielle rounded the corner. As usual, the most striking thing about Danielle was her flowing red hair. This particular day it contrasted nicely against her charcoal gray pencil skirt. She traded pleasantries with Izzy and Mark before addressing Gemma.

“I’m Danielle Fuller, one of the geologists here.”

Gemma shook her hand. “Gemma Wade. Nice to meet you.”

All four of them made some small talk while they fixed coffee and waited for the conference room to clear out. Danielle's cousin was apparently enrolled at Gemma's alma mater of Weathersby, and that gave both of them an easy topic of conversation. 2:30 came and went and Danielle was just about to find a new location when the interview ended.

“We good to go inside?” Mark asked.

“Yeah that’s fine,” Danielle said. Izzy could’ve sworn she looked a little hesitant but said nothing as they sat down and Danielle set up the projector.

The meeting itself was straightforward enough. She and Mark walked through the new program they were recommending Danielle and effectively gave both her and Gemma a crash course on how to use it. Once they started populating the program with the data Danielle provided, Izzy began to notice something.

Both Danielle and Gemma were starting to fidget. Perhaps she only had it on her mind because of recent events, but both women were soon shifting around in their chairs while Danielle developed a steady foot tap. Gemma remained engaged, but snuck periodic glances at the time in the corner of Izzy’s projected screen. She then remembered that Gemma hadn’t peed before leaving Goldfinch. It seemed like an uncharacteristically rookie move for someone who’d been a total professional from the start.

“Is there anything else you need from us?” Izzy asked as they wrapped up.

“That seems to be everything at the moment. There’s probably something I’m missing, but I’ll just call or email you,” Danielle said.

“Perfect. Thanks so much,” Izzy said.

“Wonderful. Nice seeing you two again and nice meeting you, Gemma,” Danielle said. She shot a quick glance at the time and clasped her hands. “I’d walk you guys out but I really have to get to something before my next call.”

“Of course. Till next time!” Mark said.

They put their empty mugs in the breakroom dishwasher and heard footsteps. Danielle waved before rounding the corner and shutting the bathroom door. Apparently she had to go after all.

It had rained while they were inside and a slight mist still hung over downtown Goldwood. They got in Mark’s car and he asked Gemma how it went.

“Great. You were right that she’s really easy to talk to. That program isn’t too complicated either,” Gemma said.

“Good. I like working with them quite a lot,” Mark said. He pulled out of the parking lot and headed back to the office.

Rain started falling again and as they got stuck behind a flatbed truck at a light Gemma spoke up again. “Hey guys…”

Izzy turned to the back seat feeling worried. Gemma’s usual confidence was gone. “You okay?”

Gemma sighed. “I may have done something very stupid. I forgot to pee before we left and it’s really bad. Can we stop somewhere?”

“Ok, there is definitely something in the water at Goldfinch,” Mark chuckled. “But yeah. There’s a Starbucks up ahead. Might even order something while you do that.”

“Thanks so much,” Gemma said. “I really shouldn’t have had that coffee but I wanted to be polite.”

“Happens to the best of us,” Izzy said.

The light turned green and Mark passed the big truck but only made it two blocks before hitting another red light. Izzy cast a worried glance back at Gemma whose legs were tightly crossed. Her hands were pressed into her crotch and she looked at the stoplight begging it to turn green. “Oh god. I might not make it. It’s going to be close.”

Izzy couldn’t believe her ears. Were there about to be three accidents in row?

“I’m uh… almost there,” Mark said, stumbling over his words in a bit of disbelief as well. He turned into the parking lot and Gemma hopped out of the car. She raced inside before slipping on the wet ground.

“Shit!”

She slid precariously and fell over as Izzy and Mark both ran out to go check on her. Izzy’s jaw dropped as a puddle formed around Gemma, who sat nursing her skinned knee. “I got so close,” she sighed, spreading her legs and hiking up her skirt to minimize the damage.

“It’ll be alright,” Mark said. He awkwardly shuffled over and Izzy realized why, tapping her dress. Gemma blushed and fixed her pleated skirt to cover up an exposed shot of her darkening red panties.

“How bad’s the damage?” Izzy finally asked.

“Honestly not as bad as it could’ve been. If anyone asks, I’ll say I just slipped in a puddle, which is kind of true,” Gemma said.

“That’s fair enough,” Izzy said. “Maybe tomorrow will finally be our normal day.”

Gemma followed her and Mark back to the car shaking off her bruised ego. “That’d be nice.”

Gemma snuck out a little early leaving Izzy and Mark in awkward silence for the last few minutes.

“Something weird is going on,” Izzy said.

“Yeah it’s that we’ve all forgotten how to hold our pee apparently,” Mark said. “Do I need to wear a diaper tomorrow to be safe?”

Izzy laughed at the funny mental image. “Maybe so. This office might be cursed."

“You’re funny, Iz. See you tomorrow.”

Izzy drove home and 5:00 traffic reminded her that she hadn't emptied her own bladder since leaving before the trip to Titan. She reached the last red light before her apartment and jammed a hand into her crotch. She was desperate, but for a split second she wondered what would happen if she intentionally let go right there.

"What the hell am I thinking?"

Izzy finished the drive and raced to her toilet. She lost a few drops into her panties, but otherwise enjoyed a nice and normal pee. She washed up and forgot about that weird thought from the stoplight for the rest of the night.

Mark’s Day

Mark hit the snooze alarm in frustration after being rudely interrupted from a dream involving Izzy, Kara, and Gemma. While Izzy remained his primary work crush, he certainly wasn’t complaining that Kara had wet while Gemma seemingly came close. He had just a single message on YellowFlow, WetCrystal saying “Gemma’s such a pretty name! I love it!” to his suggestion on a character name. He had later felt a bit weird after arbitrarily throwing out another coworker’s name, but if Crystal liked the idea, he’d keep her happy. Mark got going and put on an alternative playlist, pulling into work at the conclusion of “Dirty Little Secret” by the All American Rejects.

8:03. A nice and normal day.

The morning lived up to Izzy’s request for an ordinary day, although Mark did test the waters joking that it was either his or Gemma’s turn to wet their pants. He worked on some files for Danielle and helped Gemma through a training module when he had a little bit of time. The one thing that did stimulate his fetish brain was Izzy and Gemma both peeing quite often. He couldn’t tell if Gemma’s bladder was small or she just suffered consequences from her over the top hydration patterns, but he wasn’t complaining. Interestingly, she never peed before they left for Titan’s office.

The both arrived at Titan early and had the start of their meeting running late. He, Gemma, and Izzy all gathered in the breakroom where they talked with Danielle. The red haired geologist was a total knockout and he had admittedly crept on her Facebook profile before, which showed her dating a lucky guy named David and getting up to various shenanigans with her friends. But as they made small talk and she introduced herself to Gemma, Mark couldn’t help noticing Danielle felt a bit on edge. A part of him wondered if she had to pee, but dismissed that as his fetish taking up too much real estate in his head.

.…until the meeting was a good bit underway. Danielle shifted in her chair while developing a steady foot tap. Next to her, Gemma looked squeamish as well and kept glancing at the time. He tried his hardest to focus on the presentation at hand and was quite relieved when the last half hour was primarily an exchange between Danielle and Izzy with Gemma popping in with a few questions. The meeting ended and Danielle vaguely said she had “to get to something before my next call”. As the Goldfinch crew put their mugs in the sink, “something” was in fact revealed to be a furious march to the bathroom. The door shut quite forcefully and Mark could envision the sight taking place behind it. Had Danielle leaked during the meeting? What about on the toilet when hiking up her skirt? A desperation sighting like that would've normally been his best sighting in months, but it was just a bronze medal for that week alone!

Mark had only made it to the second light when Gemma spoke up, uncharacteristically nervous. “Hey guys?”

“You okay?” Izzy asked.

Gemma sighed. “I may have done something very stupid. I forgot to pee before we left and it’s really bad. Can we stop somewhere?”

“Ok, there is definitely something in the water at Goldfinch,” Mark chuckled. “But yeah. There’s a Starbucks up ahead. Might even order something while you do that.”

“Thanks so much,” Gemma said. “I really shouldn’t have had that coffee but I wanted to be polite.”

“Happens to the best of us,” Izzy said.

Mark navigated the wet road as best he could, mindful of Gemma’s bladder. He even pinched himself at a red light to make sure he wasn’t in a weird fantasy dream. But the light turned and the asshole behind him honked after half a second of delay. He pulled into Starbucks and Gemma scrambled out of the car. She took off running and what followed felt like a car crash in slow motion. Gemma screamed as she slipped on the wet ground before landing on her ass. As he and Izzy scrambled out of the car, Mark adjusted his stature to hide his erection as Gemma soaked both her skirt as well as her exposed red panties. He shuffled over to avoid being a total pervert, but his heart pounded while his brain struggled to comprehend the sheer unprecedented odds of three accidents in as many days.

“How bad’s the damage?” Izzy finally asked.

“Honestly not as bad as it could’ve been. If anyone asks, I’ll say I just slipped in a puddle, which is kind of true,” Gemma said.

“That’s fair enough,” Izzy said. “Maybe tomorrow will finally be our normal day.”

Gemma followed Mark and Izzy back to the car. “That’d be nice.”

They returned to the office at basically five, and for Gemma’s sake Mark was glad Jacob was too busy to ask her how it went. Gemma snuck out at 4:57 and Mark turned to Izzy once the door shut behind her. “Did that really happen?” He asked.

“Something weird is going on,” Izzy said.

“Yeah it’s that we’ve all forgotten how to hold our pee apparently,” Mark said. “Do I need to wear a diaper tomorrow to be safe?”

Izzy laughed. “Maybe so. This office might be cursed.

Mark paused briefly. That wasn’t a particular corner of the fetish he’d explored before, but Izzy hadn’t recoiled in disgust like he half expected. “You’re funny, Iz. See you tomorrow.”

Mark drove home and found a new message waiting for him on YellowFlow. WetCrystal was waiting for him on YellowFlow, and a perhaps predictable thing happened during the roleplay. By arbitrarily naming Crystal’s character “Gemma” some wires got crossed. Despite the scenario being based on Izzy’s accident, his mind kept wandering to the real Gemma’s accident that afternoon. He finished stroking his dick after the session mostly aroused, but also conflicted. As ingrained in him as the fetish was, fantasizing about anyone having an accident against their will had an inherent “ick” factor once the euphoria of the fantasy faded. Especially the new hire whom he’d only known for a few days.

Gemma’s Day

Gemma had barely slept after waking at three with her next move. WetCrystal and PuddlePirate were roleplaying that evening and she had the perfect plan to work her way into Mark’s subconscious beforehand. Little was going on at work, but there was one opportunity to steal the show. Mark liked desperation and she’d tease him just enough to make herself irresistible. She arrived in her parking spot where she finished “Mastermind” by Taylor Swift.

7:49. A nice and normal day.

Or was it?

She headed inside and once Izzy arrived, she quietly asked for an update on Kara. Apparently she had laughed it off, which was a relief. Kara was quite hot and Gemma was certainly down to make her wet later, preferably in pants that would create a bigger stain than her birthday dress. She got to work and let her giant water bottle fill her bladder in preparation for the day’s main event. Izzy’s small bladder filled at about the same pace and Gemma regularly left after her in hopes of hearing a monster stream or catching some wet panties in the trash.

The latter was of course a fantasy, even for someone who’d been as fortunate at bringing them to life. Still, the time for the Titan meeting inched closer and Gemma “forgot” to pee before they left. She’d let her bladder fill before dashing to the bathroom back at Goldfinch, exaggerating her need around Mark if she had to.

They arrived at Titan’s office and an interesting opportunity presented itself. The meeting was running late and Danielle had been surprised to see them so early. Similar to Monday with Izzy, Gemma opted to very subtly push her luck by keeping Danielle talking and making it harder for her to slip away to the bathroom if she needed it. Danielle's cousin just so happened to attend the college Gemma used for her fictious business degree, and she had researched enough about the university to avoid suspicion. Just when it looked like Danielle might nip around the corner for the toilet, the conference room cleared up. Already behind schedule, they started right away.

While Gemma had played around with the program Mark and Izzy were showcasing, the majority of the information wasn’t retained in favor of focusing on a much more interesting topic. Danielle sat with crossed legs and a foot tapping for the majority of the meeting. Gemma fantasized about watching her have an accident right there in the boardroom, but those thoughts were joined by an concurrent focus.

Gemma hadn’t expected Tamara to offer them coffee, and her own bladder was filling up faster than she expected. Her urge continued to build and she snuck a glance at the clock and saw the meeting was only half over, if that. Danielle repositioned her chair and ended up sitting on her foot for a bit. Gemma looked down into her mug to see how mug coffee remained and realized it was nearly empty.

“I may have misjudged”. It wasn’t the end of the world, but her mad dash to the bathroom back at Goldfinch was sure to capture Mark’s attention now. She squirmed a bit longer as Izzy and Danielle dominated most of the last half-hour’s discussion.

Then Gemma felt something wet. A single drop leaked out, but her body launched straight into panic mode. The meeting wound down and before she could ask where the bathroom was, Danielle was heading there herself. Gemma wanted to watch in awe as she raced to the bathroom, but her bladder was so full that preventing her own accident took top priority. A few more drops escaped as she put her mug in the breakroom sink. It wasn’t a far drive back to Goldfinch. She could hold on, though the drizzle outside certainly wasn't helping.

Mark hit the first red light and another spurt escaped. Gemma reached under her skirt and blushed at how wet her panties were getting. She had somehow drastically overestimated her holding capacity.

“Hey guys?” Gemma asked. She wasn’t quite sure where the mock embarrassment in her voice ended and the genuine shame began.

“You okay?” Izzy asked.

Gemma sighed. “I may have done something very stupid. I forgot to pee before we left and it’s really bad. Can we stop somewhere?”

“Ok, there is definitely something in the water at Goldfinch,” Mark chuckled. “But yeah. There’s a Starbucks up ahead. Might even order something while you do that.”

“Thanks so much,” Gemma said. “I really shouldn’t have had that coffee but I wanted to be polite.” That was true, but certainly not the whole truth. She punched Starbucks into her maps app and her heart pounded as the little blue dot drove closer. She had gotten rather desperate towards the end of the night at Soto’s. That had nothing on the true race against time unfolding inside her bladder. Mark parked and Gemma ran out before making a crucial mistake.

She didn’t watch her step and slid a bit before landing on her ass. The shock was too much as the impact dealt the knockout blow to her overbloated bladder. She remained on the ground, completely helpless as a torrent poured out of her. It was as if her bladder was mocking her for the coffee and skipped bathroom trips, and as much as it hurt to admit, she deserved it. She lifted her skirt a bit to prevent a giant wet spot from forming around her ass and angled the gap between her legs to flash Mark a peek at her flooded panties. He shuffled to the side awkwardly, and Gemma hoped he caught a glimpse.

"My bladder isn't as strong as I thought." Gemma had been hyperfixated on this fetish for years, but when the chips were down and it was time to stage a near miss, she couldn't hold it. That was just as shameful as it was erotic.

“How bad’s the damage?” Izzy finally asked.

“Honestly not as bad as it could’ve been. If anyone asks, I’ll say I just slipped in a puddle, which is kind of true,” Gemma said.

“That’s fair enough,” Izzy said. “Maybe tomorrow will finally be our normal day.”

Gemma followed Mark and Izzy back to the car shaking off her bruised ego. “That’d be nice.” She sat in backseat shaking from both humiliation and arousal. She had only wet herself in public once, an intentional wetting where she waited to the absolute verge of an accident before running into a gas station and losing control at the back of the store. Only a few employees and shoppers that she never saw again had witnessed it. But here?

She had wet herself in front of Mark. Even if she’d tried to hold it and leave him wanting more, she was now in the mix with Izzy and Kara. Her excessive hydration habits and long meetings of an office job would create even more opportunities for him to see her desperate. Her fantasy of being fucked after hours on the boardroom table in her wet dress might come true the next week for all she knew.

Gemma snuck out a little early and went home, where she sat in her wet clothes while roleplaying. WetCrystal and PuddlePirate always had a good rapport, but now that she had been around him in person and wet herself in front of him? Her arousal only heightened, especially when she asked Mark’s character to repeatedly say Gemma's name. Even if it was clearly a roleplay of Izzy's accident, it felt great to witness Mark wanting "Gemma". Once the session finally end, Gemma headed to the bathroom she stood in front of the mirror. The pee on her skirt had dried and her underwear was now a different kind of wet.

She would have to be careful the next few days. Her genuine accident had thrown off her timeline and there was no way in hell she could allow four accidents in a row. It was simply too weird to be a coincidence. Still, Gemma reached into her soaked panties and pleasured herself again for good measure. She had completely humiliated herself in front of Mark, yet he was clearly into that.

“Even when Gemma Wade loses, she wins.”
