The Amber Fountain

Long ago, the people of the desert kingdom lived in harmony with nature and the seasons’ cycles. Every year, in the spring, the river would overflow as the snowmelt from faraway mountains burst its banks, and every year, in the fall, the people would reap a rich harvest from their fields thanks to the fertile silt the river left behind.

This cycle continued for time immemorial, until an ambitious king came to power, Marius the First. The king promised the people that, with the aid of his court magicians, he would teach them to control the flow of the river. No longer dependent on the cycle of the seasons, they could reap two or three harvests each year, and enjoy as much water as they wanted during the long, dry winters.

King Marius ordered the construction of a massive dam at the headwaters of the river, and drafted all the able-bodied workers of the kingdom to speed its completion. With the power of the dam, he would hold back the river as long as he desired, releasing it only according to his master plan for the kingdom. He ordered the temple of the River Goddess destroyed, planning to use the stone and precious metals to erect a new temple to his own intellect and greatness.

On the last day of spring, the King assembled all his generals and ministers at the foot of the dam, for a speech marking its grand opening. He mocked the river goddess, and declared that from now on, the only ruler of the river would be him. Just as the King finished his speech, and went to lay the final stone of the dam, it sprung a leak. Then a spurt. Then came the flood, as the stone bulged outwards with the pressure of waters held back too long, and the gates tore open, soaking everything downstream.

Downriver, as the waters tore through the city, the people cried out to their old patroness, the river goddess, to save them. They begged her to stop the flood and spare their lives. She obliged, and the river never flowed again. A thousand years later, the kingdom lies buried beneath shifting sands, and only one source of flowing water survives, in the ruined Temple of the River Goddess- the legendary Amber Fountain. The powerful magic of the desert burns away the very blood of the body, turning would-be adventurers to dust, but only once a group of heroes manages to carry a vial of holy water to the Fountain and appease the Goddess will the waters flow once again.

“That,” Kendra said, her arms crossed, “is the stupidest plot I have ever heard.”

“So all the people are, like, thirsty?” Sophie said, her index finger lightly tapping her drink.

“I brought Mechwarrior,” Anna said, hopefully, to no one in particular.

“It’s my party, so I get to pick what we play!” Stella said. “I found the book in my parents’ attic when I was home last Christmas- it’s like, zeroth edition D&D. A classic…”

“What’s that for, then?” Kendra replied, gesturing towards the tall copper-colored jug in the center of the table.

“It’s an amphora,” Britney said, her eyes glimmering in realization.

“It’s the Amphora of the River Goddess,” Stella said, “and that’s how you’re going to reach the fountain! Only drinking water blessed by the goddess can protect you from the curse!”

“But the curse is only in the game,” Sophie said.

“That’s probably going to give us tetanus,” Kendra fumed.

“Okay, fine, it’s three liters of ginger ale and vodka in a flower vase I bought at the thrift store last weekend. But I washed it really good! And the first distilled liquor in history was called aqua vitae, the water of life, so in a sense, it IS holy water,” Stella said triumphantly.

The group had all met in college, a few years back, when Stella had recruited whomever she could from her freshman dorm to join a Dungeons and Dragons group. Playing the game had eased the social transition into college considerably, and even as they found their own clubs and interests besides, the women had stuck together all the way through graduation.

Of course, they had scattered across the country afterwards, finding (and losing) jobs, partners, and so on. Their last campaign, a Discord-based Dark Heresy game, had gradually petered out a few months ago. But when Stella had invited everyone to visit for a weekend as a reunion of sorts, she had insisted that the first activity be what had originally brought them together: a nice Friday night tabletop gaming session.

Now, they were gathered around a long wooden table in Stella’s dining room, converted for the occasion into a gaming den. Stella sat at the head of the table, her tumbling blonde curls and mischievous blue eyes partially hidden by a cardboard screen. To her left was Kendra, who Sophie had once dubbed “very short, but with tall vibes.” Her long, dark hair was done up in a messy ponytail, and her foot tapped ever so slightly beneath the table.

Across from Kendra was Sophie, a tall redhead with elegantly painted emerald nails which neatly set off her green eyes. At the far end from Stella, there was Anna, a mousy brunette in a wildly oversized Metallica tee that hung past her tiny jean shorts, To Sophie’s right sat Britney, in a long red dress more suited for the nightclub than their current surroundings.

Stella vanished into the kitchen for a moment, and returned with five tall glasses, into which she poured the liquid from the improvised amphora. She settled back into the comfy armchair she had earlier dragged to the table, and outlined the scenario for the group. Their characters, various adventurers from across the realms, had gathered to attempt to reach the legendary Amber Fountain, at the heart of the buried city of Al’Tazz. A vengeful goddess’s curse over the area would evaporate any liquid they carried, even the blood from inside their bodies, so they would need to drink a special elixir of holy water to reach the fountain. Stella was midway through explaining the detailed supplemental rules for dehydration and exhaustion when Anna interrupted.

“Wait, so at the end, we- our characters I mean- are supposed to just PEE the water into the fountain?”

“Could have just played FATAL instead,” Kendra muttered.

Stella chuckled nervously. “Well, no, I was getting to that part. There’s a magic item inside the dungeon that will let you extract the water from your bodies at the end.”

“But if we did pee, then we’d be out of luck,” Sophie opined, “because that would be the last of the water.”

“You could do a Bear Grylls situation,” Britney pointed out, “and probably recycle the water for a while, if it came to it.”

“Nobody is peeing or drinking pee!” Stella said. “Just think of it as like, a magic dimension, where nobody pees, okay?”

After a spirited discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of a magic dimension where nobody peed, , Stella put her foot down, and the game started in earnest. Stella began to read from the sourcebook she had brought, a dogeared hardcover that looked like it hadn’t seen daylight in half a century:

After many days of travel through the hostile desert, and many terrifying perils, you have finally arrived at your destination. Before you lie the ruins of the once-mighty Desert Kingdom, which in its heyday ruled the land from the Sunrise Mountains to the Bitter Sea. Its capital city, Al’Tazz, was destroyed by the wrath of the gods long ago, in a cataclysm of floods and droughts that has passed from memory to myth, from myth to legend.

At first, you wonder if your maps were accurate. The road peters out into trackless desert, and all around you see nothing but shifting sands. The midday sun beats heavy on your necks, and the ground shimmers with the unrelenting heat.

“Take one level of exhaustion,” Stella announced.

“But we haven’t even started yet!” Anna protested.

“I don’t make the rules,” Stella shrugged. “I mean, I literally make the rules, but this is what the book says. Do I need to go over the dehydration stuff again?”

Cowed by this threat, the group moved on. Kendra’s character, a rogue, was unanimously nominated as the best choice to search for the temple entrance, with the assistance of Sophie’s ranger. A few rolls later, they unearthed a tunnel, which led to an underground gate.

Kendra shifted in her seat. “I examine the gate.”

“Roll Investigation,” Stella said.

“Seventeen. Plus five, so twenty-two.”

“Excellent,” Stella purred. “The gate is of weather-beaten copper, in no style you have ever seen. At the foot of the gate, barely visible under the dust, there is an inscription. In the language of the Desert Kingdom…”

“Which we all took at character creation,” Sophie coughed.

“Which of course you did, for no metagame reason at all,” Stella continued. “In the language of the Desert Kingdom, the inscription reads, ‘Welcome, traveller, to the Threshold of the Throne. Render your tribute, and enter.’ Besides it is an engraving of travelers bowing and offering their gifts to the King.”

“Render your tribute, and enter…” Anna pondered.

Kendra’s rogue tried to pick the gate’s lock, and failed. Sophie’s ranger sent her animal companion to reconnoiter, but this yielded only news of a deeper, darker tunnel beyond. Anna and Britney racked their brains for any magic their wizard and cleric had that might help, but achieved nothing except wasting a few spell slots and creating a rather unique fireworks display in the confined space. The group collected all their gold and silver pieces together, and made a neat pile in front of the inscription, but this yielded nothing either.

Once the group had clearly hit a wall, Stella looked down the table at Anna.

“Your wizard is proficient in History, right? Do you want to roll a skill check?”

Anna nodded, and even before the clattering die had rolled to a stop Stella continued:

“This was built in two phases, remember? The King tore down the Goddess’s old temple, and started building his own. So the ‘Threshold to the Throne’ is the entrance hall to what he thought would be his temple. What kind of tribute do you think he wants?”

Anna’s brows furrowed in thought. Kendra crossed her arms across her chest and bit her lip absentmindedly, her eyes darting back and forth. Britney Googled something on her phone. Sophie was the first to speak:

“Well, the King is all about control, right? The city got destroyed because he wouldn’t just let the water flow.” Kendra winced slightly at this and crossed her legs.

Sophie went on, oblivious, “So he wants to prove he’s in control, and that everyone obeys him.”

“But what are we supposed to give him?” Britney asked. “We barely have anything worth anything.”

“I have an idea,” Anna piped up. “I kneel before the inscription.” The rest of the group quickly agreed to join her.

Stella smirked. “You hear a *click*, as if of a pressure plate. The gate swings open.”

By this point, Kendra’s legs were tightly crossed, and she had been rocking gently back and forth in her seat for the last ten minutes. “Great, then,” she said, standing up. “I need to head to the throne in real life, because I am on the threshold of peeing my pants. Stella, where’s your bathroom?”

“Upstairs, off the bedroom,” Stella replied. “There’s a half-bath in the front hallway, but I’m renovating and I forgot to schedule the plumber to connect the new fittings,” she said grinning sheepishly.

“Got it,” Kendra said, allowing her thighs a minute squeeze. She could feel the waistband of her tight jeans cutting into her bladder- actually, she’d been able to feel that when she arrived, but she’d been running rather late, and Stella had launched right into her spiel when Kendra was barely in the door.

She normally considered herself able to hold it in as long as she needed or wanted to- the product of a lifelong aversion to public bathrooms, plus the regrettable working conditions of her job as a high school teacher. But it was getting to the point where she couldn’t focus, and she wanted to enjoy the night with her friends. She walked back to the front hallway, half-skipped up the stairs- had it been this urgent before? Thinking back, she hadn’t actually used the restroom since leaving her apartment for the airport at ten o’clock that morning. Her bladder cramped fiercely, and she strode decisively into the bedroom and through the bathroom door. She wriggled down her jeans, sat on the cool seat- god, she had to PISS- and, just as blissful relief was at hand…

The rogue, Cassandra, blinked and looked around. She was in a dim tunnel. There was a large copper gate before her, one door swung wide open. She was clad in tight-fitting leather armor, and wrapped all about with a grey-blue cloak. She was acutely conscious of how tight-fitting the leather armor was, because it was squishing her overfull bladder like a boa constrictor. And wait, her name wasn’t Cassandra, it was Kendra.

“WHAT THE HELL?” Cassandra/Kendra screamed, in the tunnel, in the dark.

*001*2025-09-05 21:22

“The gates lie open before you,” Stella intoned solemnly, “into the depths of the ruined city. Dare you venture within?”

“Oh, we dare,” Sophie replied, taking a long slug of her cup and splashing a little on the neck of her white dress.

“Shouldn’t we wait for Kendra?” Anna interjected.

“We can say she’s scouting ahead for a bit,” Stella said. “We have a lot of dungeon to get through, and I want to keep things moving. Do you all, ah, dare?”

“Sure,” Britney said. Stella began to narrate once again:

The dark tunnel descend- deeperand deeper, until you feel sure you’ll suffocate on the stale, stiflingair. Suddenly, you feel a cool breeze across your faces- but that can’t be possible this deep down, can it? The path takes a turn, and you emerge into a vast open space, lit from far above by what seems like sunlight- ancient magic or deep-driven shafts, you can’t quite tell. All around you are the remains of plants both common and wondrous, long since dried to fossils, crumbling at the slightest touch. You rack your brains, and remember: this must be the Gardens of the Goddess, the sacred terraces which encircled the inner sanctum of her temple. From somewhere in the parchment-dry foliage, you hear a high, keening cry…

“Roll initiative!” Stella yelled, leaping from her seat. Anna started suddenly- Sophie simply grinned and leaned in, while Britney remained unmoved. The party found themselves swarmed by jackalweres, jackal-headed cursed servants of the Goddess, and without Kendra’s damage output they were hard-pressed. Finally, Sophie and Britney managed to hem most of the monsters into a corner.

“Anna, it’s your turn,” Stella said. “Anna?”

Anna, who had been staring off into the vague middle distance, spoke primly and matter of factly. “I cast fireball,” she said.

“Are you sure?” Stella said, “Yes!” Sophie said, and “No!” Britney said, all at the same time.

“Quiet down ya’ll, it’s her turn,” Stella chided. She peered down the table at Anna. “Anna, are you sure?”

Anna looked down at her character sheet, only once, briefly. “Yes. I cast fireball.”

“Okay,” Stella breathed, an entirely unwholesome grin spreading across her rosy features. “You cast fireball, and the last of the jackalweres burn up, and-“

“I didn’t even roll for damage!” Anna protested.

“Oh, yes,” Stella said, “go ahead and roll for damage. Double it. I mean, triple it. Because you cast fireball, in a giant room with ventilation, stacked to the ceiling with dry wood.”

“Oh,” Anna said, a few stray d6s dropping from the pile in her hand, “Oh, no.”

“I told you so,” Britney sighed. “Well, I was trying to tell you...”

Meanwhile…

Kendra paced furiously along the tunnel, her hands balled into fists at her side. Had the drinks been spiked? Was this a prank? A dream? Had she fallen asleep? Was her entire memory of a game and a weekend trip just one of those really elaborate dreams, where you have to pee really bad but keep running into absurd obstacles until you’re finally just about to pee and you suddenly wake up? But when she had started to pee, she hadn’t woken up in bed, she’d woken up here. Her bladder throbbed, reminding her she had started to pee, not actually, say, peed. She had loosened the straps on her leather pants as far as she dared, and they were starting to chafe quite unpleasantly. A particularly intense urge overtook her for a moment, and she doubled over, taking advantage of the privacy of the tunnel to press her fingers directly into her… high-waisted garters? What the hell was this fantasy-world underwear anyway?

Fuck it, no one was likely to come this way anyway. If it was a dream, she’d would only wet the bed, and if it wasn’t… best not to think about that. She pulled her pants down, spent a few agonizing minutes fiddling with the dozen or so clutches and buttons on the absurdly impractical garters, and finally dropped into a squatting position, braced against the wall of the tunnel. A voice boomed out-

KEEP THE FAITH, ADVENTURER!

Startled, she fell back against the wall just as a spurt of pee jetted past her lower lips and to the floor. She swore, and curled into a defensive ball, her bladder protesting vociferously against this unexpected interruption.

FURTHER WEAKNESS WILL NOT BE PERMITTED! KEEP THE FAITH, ADVENTURER!

Definitely a weird pee dream. She spoke, in a voice more tremulous than she had hoped:

“Who is that? Who are you? Where are you?” She glanced around, suspiciously. “Were you watching that? Fucking creep!”

I AM THE GUARDIAN OF THIS PLACE.

“Where am I?” Kendra asked, regaining some of her physical and metaphorical footing.

YOU HAVE EMBARKED UPON A QUEST WITHIN THE SACRED TEMPLE OF THE GODDESS. NOW, THERE IS NO TURNING BACK. ONLY DEATH OR VICTORY.

“What is the quest?”

TO BEAR THE HOLY WATER SAFELY TO THE AMBER FOUNTAIN, AND SO PURGE THE EVIL FROM THIS PLACE.

“How do I do that?”

YOU MUST USE THE POWER WITHIN.

“Can you be more specific?”

NO.

Kendra thought back to Stella’s endless, tortured exposition, about transporting the holy water inside their own bodies, and moaned.

“Do you mean the power within my bladder?”

YES.

“Well that’s hopeless, then. I was about ten minutes from wetting my jeans before you dragged me to- whatever this is- and I’m certainly not holding it into the depths of the temple or whatever. What if I just pee and leave?”

YOU WILL DIE. ONLY THE HOLY WATER WITHIN YOU KEEPS AWAY THE POWER OF THE CURSE. SHOULD IT PASS AWAY- SO SHALL YOU. PAINFULLY.

“Great. Lovely. Fabulous. I’ll just piss myself, then die.” Kendra awkwardly stood up and leaned against the wall, her back arched, the swell of her lower torso distinct against her otherwise slim form. She let her mind wander. She could remember her real life, in the other world- but new things, too. Sneaking around a city. Stealing things. Learning basic magic. Right- when she had created this character, she had made an Arcane Trickster. Absolutely suboptimal choice, really, useful only for flavor purposes. Lots of very situational spells. She thought through her spell list. Prestidigitation- that could clean things, which would be useful, if peeing her pants wouldn’t literally kill her first. Mage Hand- she could think of several uses for that, but most would only prolong the inevitable. Shape Water…

Her bladder was definitely smaller than a five-foot cube. But it normally only worked with water you could see- how would the spell react to her targeting her own body? She relaxed, closed her eyes, tried to focus within and picture the liquid currently filling her overworked organ to the brim. She whimpered, slightly, at the mental image. She reached out with her mind, willing the water to shrink. Water was nearly incompressible at room temperature, not much to do there, but anything helped.

She willed it upwards, then, away from her sphincter, and gasped with the strange sensation. Her bladder was still unmistakably full, but- one way to find out. She squatted back down, casting one more furtive glance at the empty tunnel. She relaxed her muscles, and nothing came. All that pee was still pressing against the walls of her bladder, but as long as the spell lasted, one hour, it physically could not come out, willed upwards by the power of the magic. When the spell ran out, though… She gingerly re-buckled the garters and pants, just enough to keep them from falling down, and continued along the tunnel, spiraling ever downwards.

Meanwhile… (again)

“We cannot keep setting everything on fire as a solution!” Britney said.

“This was a special case!” Anna said. “So was the vampire’s castle, and the rogue trader’s ship…”

“However,” Stella noted, “you have survived. For now. Seriously though, where is Kendra?”

The question floated in the air, unanswered.

“I can check on her,” Sophie volunteered. Her interest in the other woman’s whereabouts was not entirely academic- Stella had said there was only one working bathroom, and the various drinks of the night, while delicious, had rapidly been making their presence felt in her lower abdomen. In college, she had been famous for two things: always having to pee, and being willing to pee almost anywhere when the urge struck. Notwithstanding her lust for margaritas and her admittedly tiny capacity, she had never, ever wet herself, despite peeing in alleyways, parking lots, and, on one memorable occasion, an empty classroom, behind a particularly loathed professor’s desk.

However, as Sophie stood and headed for the hallway, her admittedly pressing urge to urinate was not actually the first need on her mind. Passing the stairwell, she headed for the back door, quietly slipped out, and felt around in her fashionable clutch bag. Right where she’d left them- a half-empty pack of American Spirits, and a gas-station Bic lighter. She’d picked up smoking senior year, on study abroad, and managed to hide the habit from both her parents and her friends (her mother would have killed her, and then Stella would have mangled the remains). But for the last half-hour she had felt the growing itch, and knocking back the mixed drinks Stella had prepared, however delicious, was no longer doing much to kill the feeling. She took once last glance towards the house, walked to roughly the middle of the quiet backyard, lit up, and took a long, glorious drag.

Her shoulders relaxed, and she sighed. She would quit, eventually. All the kids were vaping now, and that was probably worse in the long run. But she had always found something authentic about an actual cigarette, taken a deep pleasure in the rough smoke and the light burn against her lips. If something was going to kill you, it shouldn’t taste like banana passionfruit- it should hurt.

For five or six minutes, she stood, quietly, making it last. Finally, she stubbed the butt out on a concrete planter, and rolled it into the tangle of the hedge at the yard’s end, mentally apologizing to Stella and God and whoever for littering. Her bladder twinged, reminding her of her other unmentioned reason for taking a break. She looked back at the house. There was the group, talking animatedly at the dining room table- there was the light on in the upstairs bathroom, still.

“Who the fuck takes a shit at a party?” she said to the empty yard. She should be a good friend, and make sure Kendra wasn’t puking or worse. She would, in a moment, but before then, for old time’s sake… she couldn’t. Peeing drunkenly behind a frat house was one thing, but peeing drunkenly behind her friend’s home?

She would quit eventually.

She pulled off her entirely unfashionable granny panties, and folded them carefully on the planter. After one last glance back at the house, she squatted down, held the hem of her dress carefully away from her stream-to-be, like she had so many times. She relaxed, and- just when blissful relief was at hand!

The ranger, Silviana, blinked and looked around. She was in a vast greenhouse, or underground garden. She was clad in long, flowing white robes, completely impractical for her branch and thorn-laden surroundings, but excellent for keeping off the heat of the open desert. A light breeze made her very aware she was wearing nothing beneath the robes. The simmering embers on the breeze made her aware the garden was OH SHIT ON FIRE.

Silviana ran, blindly, the desiccated plants tearing at her robes, the smoke stinging her eyes. Finally, she reached a sheltered alcove of some kind, managed to steal a breath of cool air, a relief to her raw throat. She rested a moment, sought her bearings. But her name wasn’t Silviana… it was Sophie.
