I have an idea on Padme having an accident in the black Varykino gown which she wore when confessing her feeling to Anakin, but the accident does not take place on that time. One of the picture I visualized will be Padme lifting the skirt but able to pull down the panties on time, and piss through the panties. And she's not in the toilet, maybe some corner?

Please gimme some suggestion so that I can write it into a full story. 😘
