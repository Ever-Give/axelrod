I'm trying to find a copy or an archive of a story centered on Link from Twilight Princess that used to be on here but doesn't seem to be anymore; does anyone have a copy of the fic by chance?

I found the original link to the story in question, though it has since been taken down

$/14985-the-legend-of-zelda-links-desperation/

Could still be of some use in a search though
