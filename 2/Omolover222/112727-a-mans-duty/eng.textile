This is a one-shot story. However, I may update/re-write certain chapters at regular intervals.

Contains male omorashi (duh).

CONCEPT:

A city/country in which men are discouraged from peeing. Not just in public but peeing altogether, until certain times of the day.

Extreme desperation as expected.

Character descriptions and stories to come shortly!

Let me know if you want to request anything in the mean time!

I have some personal stuff so this will be a month or so before the next part comes up (sorry) but if you guys want any extra scenarios/characters/dynamics to be seen then just leave them below and I'll try to incorporate it into the story

So it’ll be about a week before I can commit enough time to fully work on the story… I might make it into a browser game? Would you guys prefer that or do you just want it as a story form. Either works for me but…

Why not both?

Yeah I can try that. The game will involve like random bits of second person dialogue that will appear for you as descriptors so it might work. Not too sure...

The game may also introduce female characters for more rep but at first will be all male. It will take a while tho. I'll post little demos here if I'm allowed and then finally post the full beta when it's ready in the files.
