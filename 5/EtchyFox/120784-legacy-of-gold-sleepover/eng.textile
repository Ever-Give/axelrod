Hello friends!

Long time no post~

&&

Please enjoy this peek into the lives of Lucky, Kira, Skye, Meiko and Seren from my upcoming Legacy of Gold game series~ You can find the original below!

We are working on a remake of the original Audition, the entrance exams for the other girls in the main cast and a new engine for the full game~ More news to come.

The games will be illustrated by the incredibly wonderful @Jailor Eckman who also did this illustration of the end of the story~ See his excellent patreon

For other, incredibly lewd, versions~

Thanks to Sake for editing and feedback!~

In the meantime, enjoy this delightfully cute and lewd look into the middle of the story~

Currently im about a third of the way through a story with Lucky's mom Clarity and her assistant Shae showing what they get up to behind the administration screen~ I also have a few ive written in the last few years I'll be posting here soon~

@warham1995

, Thank you ^.^~ I'm looking forward to fleshing it out in the full game~ If you want more of it, I'll be posting more stories featuring the three of them soon~

@Scoobydew

, dawww~ The remake isn't going to be a puzzle game, but instead a Visual Novel with 6 endings~ That being said, the writing is already done, just waiting on the art and I got to add in even more adorable Lucky moments~

There are a few stories I've written since I've been gone that I'll be posting here over the next few weeks~ And of course I'll continue posting more stories after the remake~ I'm actually working on one right now thats about halfway done from Clarity's point of view~

@Scoobydew

Right!? I love VN's~ I feel like its the perfect medium between comics and writing~ I've always been more into longer form pieces as well and I love being able to explore the characters on a deeper level~

Actually, good moment to ask~

What would the community like to see next from a Legacy of Gold short story?~

@warham1995

For that you might have to wait for the full game since it's part of the core story, but we will see ^.^~

@brothacheese

Thank you so much >.< Seeing comments like this makes the whole process worth while~ You will absolutely be seeing muuuuuch more of Lucky and Kira~

I'm currently working on a story about Clarity (Lucky's mom) and her partner Shae, then it will most likely be a Skye or Meiko story before I get back to Lucky and Kira~
