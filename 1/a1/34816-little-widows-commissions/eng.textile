Hey gang. I know I never post anymore. But here's the deal: I'm trying to earn enough money to make a cross-country move to live with my girlfriend! However buses and apartments are not free (Or even cheap), so I am officially opening up commissions! A bit hesitant? My AO3 can be found here.

Also some of my most popular works can be found here,

Think that's about it. I reserve the right to edit or add to this as needed. Also please be aware I can only take on so many commissions at one time! I am still going to college and working full time. I Promise to be honest and upfront about whether or not I can take it on. This is my first time doing anything like this, so let’s say no more than five commissions at one time for starters. Please also be aware this is up on my tumblr too and that this number may change as time goes on, but I promise to be honest. Love you all and thank you sooo much in advance!
