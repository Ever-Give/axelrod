I am absolutely obsessed with voice, and especially "little" ddlg girl voices, I was wondering if anyone here knew where I could hire a voice actor to read a story for me, and read the little parts in her "little" voice.

Or if anyone here wants to take a crack at it, that would be amazing!

Thanks! ❤️
