Bedtime Feast

What other place than in a bed:

@@where I lay cozy and undressed,

@@while my man sat atop and caressed,

@@atop a swollen belly, perturbed and red.

His thumbs circle my neck,

@@slowly follow my spine and descend;

@@his palms came down the lower end:

@@he leaned in, arms set, and pressed.

It felt so good, too good — the best.

Out from all muscles, tingles met,

@@electrified my eyes, filled me with get,

@@when my bladder cried drops of wet.

Each push he forced, my lips gave let,

@@his hands squeezed out the trickle that kept;

@@my voice, it choked with every breathe

@@as up my waist my tickling warmth crept.

What resistance there was, knowing I in bed,

@@had all but leaked out lips, unclenched;

@@they drenched and fed my tender legs

@@with let and jets of heated wet.

He pulled the covers to take a pet

@@and found the growing hissing mess.

A fuss from anyone is a ventured guess,

@@but my man likes to put me to the test.

His fingers like the yellow swim best,

@@when his palm can kiss pissing lips with zest;

@@zealous and restless for an obnoxious squelch,

@@the inserted two hypnotized with jest.

They thrash my supple hips with unrest,

@@while the liquid stretches to my breasts..

@@it’s quite the feast for such a fest,

@@whenever my man is between my legs.
