I will be writing various modeling fiction stories and some crossover stories. I hope everyone enjoys it. I anyone wants to collaborate, just let me know. I am open to ideas. I will be returning to previous characters as usual, but also possibly doing new ones. And hopefully, my latest story about Another day in the life of a biker girl was decent. I admit it want spectacular nor exciting. Instead of writing about a major pee explosion and either making it, half making it or not at all, I chose a more mundane story.
