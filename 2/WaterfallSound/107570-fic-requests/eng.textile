I'm really bored and I need writing practice so feel free to request whatever. Any gender is fine, I can try to write for fandoms I'm not in but it might not be great, I'll probably be willing to write most things you suggest, but no guarantees.

(Non-exhaustive) Fandom List:

Cosmere

Cyberpunk

Baldurs Gate 3

The Locked Tomb

Zenless Zone Zero

Marvel

Hotline Miami

Katana Zero

Risk of Rain 2

Other things, ask me about particular fandoms

Things I Won't Do:

Diapers/padded

Scat/messing

Minors (Depending on the character, I might be willing to age them up, we'll see)

Anything else I'm uncomfortable with

Sorry, I should've said that I won't do diapers/padded stuff. Feel free to request something else, though!
