Hi, (I'm new to this forum, so if this post is in the wrong place, please let me know.)

I'm looking for a story that (I think) I read on here a while ago and I'll try to be as detailed as I can. It was a story about a female news reporter (I think her name was Grace Chen or something along those lines (I remember it was a Chinese-American name)) who was really popular with audiences because of her good looks and whatnot and the news station decided to use said looks for viewership (i.e. giving an open view of the anchors' legs under the desk just for her and whatnot), but she was disliked by her colleague because of said popularity. So her colleague decided to spike her coffee with diuretics and give her a bunch of water before going on air one day (side note that might be important:

Grace? was wearing a really short pencil skirt that barely covered her crotch and tights that day) and because of how long news anchors have to go without breaks, Grace spent most of the time squirming in her seat, but because of the open view the desk gave, she can't hold her crotch or squirm too much. I think she then ends up peeing herself during the commercial break because someone was in the bathroom, so she has to walk to her car at the end of the story without her panties or tights on, while wearing a skirt that barely covers her exposed crotch.

I think the story got deleted (can't find it anywhere), but I'm curious if anyone either had it saved, or even just remembers it too just so I know that I'm not going crazy and imagining things.
