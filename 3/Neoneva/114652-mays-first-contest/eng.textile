May’s first contest (a retelling of win lose or Drew)

All the characters are 18+

May was over the moon with joy as she finally entered her first Pokemon contest after, but now she encountered her first problem what to do with the three hours she has before the contest actually starts. Luckily for her Ash’s stomach answered for her “Some food would be perfect” She said

“And Slateport City has tons of Cafes and restaurants we can eat at” her brother Max responded, “If we’re going out I wouldn’t mind doing some shopping while we’re here” Brock added.

With they’re plans decided the group left the contest hall and walked over to a nearby cafe may ordered sandwiches for her and max and green teas for the two them Ash ordered a hamburger with a cola, and Brock got pasta with tea and some food for the Pokemon. The group happily ate their food while May talked excitedly about the contest and her routine “That’s sure to impress the judges” Brock said “You think so” She replied Max chimed in “Yeah just hearing it is making me excited”. May ordered a refill of her green tea and the group left the cafe and continued exploring the city, drinking water the whole time to stay hydrated “We should be heading back now, I want to get some practice in before the contest starts” May said the gang nodded in agreement and walked with May to the contest hall.

May spent the final hour with her Beautifly rehearsing their routine. It left her exhausted but May wanted their performance to be flawless she sat down to rest and felt a strong urge from her bladder. “I shouldn’t have drank so much” she stood up but then the speaker buzzed to life “can all contestants report the stadium repeat all contestants report to the stadium” May groaned upset that her relief would have to wait “whatever it’s nothing I can’t handle” she assured herself.

She arrived the last in line and in front of her was her rival Drew “Glad to see you May I was worried you were ahead of me” He said pretending to be concerned. “What would be so bad about that” She responded

“Because then you won’t feel as bad when I score higher than you” He said with a cocky tone. May crossed her arms and turned her head “We’ll see” She said coldly. The two stayed silent and watched as the other contestants performed unfortunately for May most of the trainers were using water types which only added to her growing discomfort “I guess Hoenn really does have too much water” she thought to herself. Eventually the liquid torture ended and Drew took to the stage he unleashed his Roselia who with the help of a petal dance gracefully landed on the stage Drew then ordered it to use a combo of stun spore and magical leaf which dazzled the audience but they weren’t done yet in a flash Roselia disappeared into a flurry of petals only for all of them to be cut down by one final magical leaf, the judges were blown away by the performance and gave Drew the biggest score yet. Drew recalled Roselia and walked back stage “Beat that” He taunted

May said nothing in return too focused on her increasing desperation which only increased as she ascended the steps onto the stage. She could feel the eyes of thousands staring down at her the intense pressure causing her to fumble with her pokeball dropping it down on the ground May bent down her bladder screamed in pain she tightly balled her fists before picking up the pokeball and releasing Beautifly. May started her routine by tossing a frisbee and Beautifly caught it with string shot and unleashed a gust attack to return it but it was a little too high and May had to jump to catch it landing sent shockwaves throughout her body and to her horror she leaked but she ignored it determined on finishing her performance.

“Beautifly use sliver wind” May commanded the Pokemon started spinning around creating a small sliver tornado, May bowed to the judges and Beautifly stopped spinning and landed gently on her head. The judges gave her performance a 24.9 slightly lower than Drew’s but she didn’t care the only thing on her mind being the ladies room in the entrance hall, but when she got backstage she was stopped by Drew

“What do you want” May spat.

“To give your Pokemon this” He pulled out a rose “It’s performance was brilliant but you have a long way to go” He teased

May thanked him for the rose and continued her walk to the bathroom until she heard her name being called out she turned around and saw that she had moved on to the second round and that Drew would be her opponent, “Just so you know I’m not gonna hold back just because it’s your first time” He said full of confidence

“I wasn’t expecting you to” She retorted

The speakers once again buzzed to life

“Round one May vs Drew will begin shortly”

“Wait we’re up first?” May said nervously

“Is that a problem” Drew asked

“Nope no problem at all just surprised” She lied

They returned to the stage May held her breath as she walked up the steps pee was leaking out every time she lifted her legs her white panties were getting more and more yellow. Finally she climbed the final step and walked onto the stage, both her and Drew grabbed a pokeball and the battle started it was her Beautifly versus Drew’s Roselia. Despite the type disadvantage Roselia was dominating the battle May did her best to command Beautifly but her mind was torn between her intense desperation and the opponent in front of her, out of nowhere a giant beam of light hit Beautifly and knocked it to the ground May hastily called it back her first contest was over and sadly it ended in defeat, but now she could finally focus on finding a bathroom. 

May bolted off the stage and ran into the hallway that led to the entrance her hands were shoved under her skirt squeezing her pussy through the soaked panties she knew it looked childish but right now it was the only thing holding back the flood. May saw the end of the hallway she slowed down her pace but before she walked out she noticed that the entrance was full of hundreds of people watching the remainder of the contest

“Crap I can’t go out there holding myself like a damn child” May thought to herself

“But it’s the only bathroom in this stupid place what am I gonna do” She continued

“Hey May you feeling okay?” A voice called out, May removed her hands her legs wrapping around each other she turned towards the voice it was Ash with Brock and Max behind him

“Yeah a little bummed out but I’m alright” she lied

“Well I’ve experienced my fair share of defeats so if you need any advice I’m here for you” Ash said

“Oh no I’ll be alright” May said, her hands were tightly gripping the hem of her skirt if she didn’t end this conversation soon her bladder would empty itself on the floor

“Well if you change your mind just let me know”

She nodded her head in response

“After that battle I think you could use some food” Brock said

Ash’s stomach growled “I think we all could” he said cheerfully

“Should we go to the cafe again?” Max asked

“No it’s probably closed by now” Brock said

“I did notice this nice place but it might be out of our price range” Ash said

May was shifting her weight from foot to foot while the boys continued their conversation. She watched the entrance waiting for the people to leave but it somehow seemed that more people have entered she couldn’t even see the doors anymore

“Sis what do you think” Max asked shocking May she turned around to face him “Well I don’t know there are just so many good options, but I’m not really hungry right now” She said trying to escape the conversation

“Come on sis I know you must want something” Max continued

“Oh well I guess we could get…” Her concentration was broken by an intense wave of pressure the pain was so great she nearly toppled over her hands flew to her crotch

“What’s wrong” Brock asked

“I need to pee really bad but I can’t get to the bathroom without those people seeing me” She said teary eyed

“Isn’t there another bathroom you can use” Max asked, May shook her head

“Maybe I can find you a bucket” Ash suggested

Her cheeks blushed bright red but she had no choice “Hurry” she said meekly Ash and Pikachu ran off determined to find a bucket

May was doing a full on potty dance she’s never felt so humiliated before “Where are they” She asked impatiently

“It’s only been a minute just try to stay calm” Brock said

“I don’t know if I can last much longer”

“Yes you can you’re the strongest lady I’ve ever met” Max said

“I don’t feel very strong” She responded

Another minute passed and May’s situation was only getting worse little rivulets of pee were coating her thighs and the waves of pressure were getting stronger by the second

“I think I’m actually gonna piss myself” May said

“It’s still too early to say that” Brock said supportingly

“I found one” Ash said with the bucket in hand

“See May I told you that you would-“Brock’s sentence was cut short by a loud hissing noise followed by sobbing. May’s bladder has finally given up pee poured through her panties and splashed onto the ground below. This was officially the worst day of her life, her piss just kept gushing out of her leaving the boys stunned May the group stood silent waiting for May to finish. After two minutes the torrent eventually stopped May was surrounded by a three foot long puddle “I’m heading back to my dressing room” She said softly her shoes squelching as she walked
