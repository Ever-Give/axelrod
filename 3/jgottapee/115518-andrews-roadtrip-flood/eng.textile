Hey! Just joined after years of lurking and am excited to share my first story on here. Hope you all enjoy, and leave some comments on what you think of the story/what other scenarios you’d want to see me write about.

###

Andrew bounces his legs in his seat. He’s gotta pee, bad, and has now for over an hour.

“Doing okay back there?” His Dad asks from the driver’s seat. They’ve been stuck in on-and-off traffic for two hours, and Andrew finished a Big Gulp at the beginning of their family roadtrip four hours ago.

“Kinda…” Andrew whines, crossing his legs. At 20 years old, this is the first roadtrip with his father and his brother he’s been on in years. He was always pretty good at holding his pee on their drives in the past, but this time he let his older brother Eli convince him to get an extra large Dr. Pepper at the gas station before they got on the highway, and now it’s all sloshing around in his bladder.

The car inches along slowly. Andrew looks out the window at the shrubs on the side of the highway longingly. He so badly needs to get out and hose them down, but he can’t with all the other cars around. No matter how much he crosses and uncrosses his legs, he’s struggling to hold it, and he’s sweating thinking about how much longer he has to wait.

Earlier in the drive, he poked some holes in his empty Big Gulp cup with his pocket knife out of boredom. It lays at his feet, taunting him. Andrew would have peed in that cup an hour ago had he not destroyed it. He’s now gripping his crotch and bouncing, and tears start to form in his eyes. He’s gotta go so bad, he’s so full it hurts.

The car is now rocking slightly from Andrew’s squirming. Eli glances at his desperate little brother in the rear view mirror from the passenger seat. Andrew has both of his hands shoved between his legs. He’s biting his lip, and his eyes are grimaced shut. A tear drips down the side of his face. Eli, always so cruel to Andrew, finds this to be hilarious. “Hey Dad, looks like Andy’s not gonna make it to the potty” He says with a chuckle, taunting Andrew like usual. “Shut up!” Andrew blurts out, turning his face away to try and hide his crying. Eli keeps his eye on Andrew in the mirror and giggles at his plight. After a minute or two, he watches as Andrew loses a long jet of pee into his cargo shorts. Andrew feverishly grasps at his crotch to try and hide the small wet spot, but it’s too late, Eli’s already seen it. He bursts out laughing. “Dad, he’s actually peeing himself!” he blurts out. Andrew stays quiet, focusing as hard as he can on regaining control. But he’s losing the battle.

He leaks again, another lengthy spurt. Andrew can’t believe it. He’s peeing his pants for the first time since he was a little kid, and he can’t do anything about it. His wet spot is growing slowly.

But just then, Eli finally gives in. “You know what’s funny, Andy?”

“What—“ Andrew manages to say through gritted teeth. Eli doesn’t respond, just waits.

Andrew opens his eyes.

Eli is turned around in his seat, presenting Andrew with his own empty Big Gulp cup from the gas station, free of holes. “Unlike you, I wasn’t stupid enough to carve mine up” Eli says as he hands Andrew the cup, “There you go, a urinal.”

Andrew snatches the cup from his brother’s hand. He can just barely move without leaking at this point, but in a frenzy, he manages to unzip and yank down his shorts and underwear. And then, it happens. As soon as his dick hits the open air, the torrent of pee comes firing out just before he can position the cup. He briefly hoses down the back of the driver’s seat, then finally gets his dick aimed into the cup. He throws his head back and shuts his eyes. The sound of his powerful stream hitting the plastic fills the car, and he lets out a loud sigh of relief.

Eli can’t control his laughter watching this scene unfold through the mirror. Andrew’s boxers are visibly soaked as they sit around his ankles. He’s completely exposed, and he continues to pee for well over a minute. The feeling is euphoric, and once he finally finishes, he just sits there as relief cascades through him.

“Wanna put your shrimp away?” Eli says under his breath, giggling. Andrew would usually be too shy to whip it out in front of anyone, let alone Eli, but he didn’t care anymore. That was, without a doubt, the best pee of his life. He filled the cup almost all the way to the top.

Eli makes fun of him over the incident periodically for the rest of the drive, but Andrew isn’t phased by it. He’s just so happy he can finally relax, even if his boxers are a little wet.
