July 3rd, 2019 - Rebecca woke up bright and early that day, excited because tomorrow was the 4th of July. She got dressed, putting on white jean shorts and a white t-shirt. She walked to her kitchen and made bacon and eggs for breakfast. She then went to the store to grab party supplies, food and drinks. When she returned home she changed into a one piece American flag Bikini, grabbed a bottle of wine and a wine glass and walked outside and layed down in her beach chair by her pool, after a couple of hours of drinking and reflecting on life she fell asleep. 

She woke up many hours later, her bladder screamed for relief and a very visible wet spot on her crotch, she placed her hands on her lower belly and felt her large bulging bladder, rock hard full of pee. Her bladder begged for relief as she stood up and walked to her back door and tried the handle, locked. She looked really confused, "I don't remember locking it" Rebecca said, just then a massive gush of urine sprayed out of her bladder. "Oh God So much pee" Rebecca said as she furiously grabbed her crotch and fought hard to stop the flow but it was no use as pee pumped out of her bladder like a fire hose, pretty soon her bladder was empty and there was a massive puddle on the floor beneath her.
