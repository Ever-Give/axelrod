So I'm curious, how popular is the choose your own adventure style really, for omo fiction?

And where is the best of it?

And who would be interested in a version of a choose your omo adventure story that played like an old school style texted based rpg game? Maybe even with illustrations eventually.

Just something I've thought about but have never really seen and maybe I'm just not looking in the right places. Okay, well let me know ðŸ«  ðŸ––ðŸ‘‹

Is this not what the interactive story board is for? This type of story rather. As for popularity I'm not really sure, but I for one am always interested in old school text rpgs. Assuming the parser is worth its salt.

Yeah, I figured there was something here to that effect.

I'm still a noob at coding, so it's not anything I could whip up in a couple weeks or months even, but eventually it is something I'd like to make and offer as a download or something.
