Unfortunately, http://holdingit.minuteboard.com/ was shut down.

There was a great story about a hospital where nurses and doctors couldn't pee. And then there was an emergency situation (loss of power or something like that), that forced them to work (and hold it) much longer.

Even fullhearts can overflow - or something like that was the title.

Has by chance somebody copied this story?

I guess there would be no harm in posting it here, since the original website has been shut down. Please correct me if I am mistaken!

Awesome, thank you!!

I can recommend the story for everyone who hasn't read it already.
