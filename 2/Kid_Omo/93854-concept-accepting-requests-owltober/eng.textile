Hello, everyone.

It's been a long time since I've published any stories. I've suddenly gotten some inspiration and want to try and use that momentum. I've also been feeling that Owl House brain rot coming on. So let's go with that.

I wanted to give myself a challenge: one Owl House omorashi fic per week (on average) for the month of October!

I've already got week 1 drafted, just need to do... a lot of editing. I have a few other ideas, but I wanted to put this out there in case anyone had something they wanted to see.

My rules:

1) I will do male or female characters, but I tend toward focusing on female characters

2) I try to be canon compliant, so I'm not comfortable doing AUs or making background characters the focus

I am willing to do alternate takes that insert desperation into canon scenes 3) I don't like to write explicitly sexual activities in my works, I'm more than happy to imply things, but don't expect in-depth descriptions

Hopefully, I should have my first story out this week.

Thanks for taking the time to read this far if you did.
