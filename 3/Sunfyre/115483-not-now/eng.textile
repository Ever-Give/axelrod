Hi everyone! It's been awhile since my last story. I finally found some time to write a bit again. I feel like I have a lot of ideas, but I always have trouble getting started or seeing my stories through to the end. But this time, I managed to get this all done in one sitting hehe! Hope you enjoy! 🙂

Haley frantically sifted through her purse, bouncing around desperately. She had barely made it home through the fifteen-minute bus ride through the city without peeing her pants, but now relief was just around the corner…literally.

“Oh come on, come on, where is it…YES!”

She pulled out her building key and fumbled with the lock until finally the key slid in with a satisfying click. Haley tried to run as fast as possible to the elevator, while keeping one hand buried in her crotch. As she turned the corner, she saw a guy step into the elevator with the doors just starting to close.

“HEY! HOLD THE DOOR, YOU ASSHOLE!” she yelled, but it was no use. The guy probably had his noise-cancelling airpods in. The doors closed just as she got there. She shoved her purse between her legs and frantically smashed the “up” button with her palm, but it was too late. The elevator had already started going up, which meant that she’d have to wait for the elevator to drop the guy off and come all the way back down. And the elevators in this shitty apartment took fucking forever to move.

“FUCK!” she cried as she crossed and uncrossed her legs. Haley had regretted wearing super tight jeans. Of course they showed off her sexy figure, but now they pressed painfully into her swollen bladder. With her luck, the guy probably lived all the way on the top floor. There was no way to know for sure, since the floor indicator in the lobby broke a long time ago, and the management didn’t bother to fix it.

After what felt like an eternity, but had probably actually been three minutes, the elevator returned to the ground floor with a ding. The doors slowly opened, and Haley jumped in, hitting the button to her floor, followed by the “close door” button multiple times, which seemed to have literally no effect. The doors closed at an equally glacial pace, and at last the elevator started moving up. 2…3…4…at least the ordeal was almost over. Haley couldn’t wait to get into her apartment, yank down her jeans, and unleash a torrent of piss into the toilet bowl.

The elevator suddenly jolted to a stop, causing Haley’s bursting bladder to protest. She almost lost it, releasing a few drops in the process, but she managed to wrestle her sphincter shut. The number was frozen at 4. Haley pressed her floor a few more times, but nothing. No fucking way…the elevator was STUCK?? Not now!! Panic started to set in. She tried all the buttons, but the elevator didn’t budge. She began pounding on the doors.

“HELLO?! Can anybody hear me?? I’m stuck in here! HELP!!”

Haley was on the verge of tears. She had made it so far, and relief was so agonizingly close. But the damn elevator was about to make her piss her pants.

“WHY?” she screamed angrily. Why did it have to be right now, and not any other time?!

“Excuse me miss, this is the fire department. We got a 911 call from this building, how can we help?”

“Huh? W-wait…yes, yes! I’m stuck in the elevator, can you get me out?!” Haley felt like there was hope. Maybe they could fix the elevator quickly and she could escape!

“We’re sending someone on the way right now, they’ll be there in thirty minutes. Please stay on the line.”

Haley’s heart dropped. Thirty minutes?! I’m not going to make it that long! This new realization somehow seemed to increase her desperation even more. She clenched her teeth and crossed her legs, trying to keep the floodgates from bursting. The pent-up piss sloshed around inside of her, trying to force its way out. Every ounce of her was screaming for relief.

“C-can you guys come any faster?”

“Miss, we’re going as fast as we can. Is there a matter that needs urgent medical attention? Is the elevator on fire?”

Haley tried everything to keep it in, bouncing up and down frantically in the cramped space. Perspiration dripped from her forehead with constant exertion. But with every passing minute, she could feel her control slipping.

“NO!”

A jet of hot piss escaped her urethra, saturating the crotch of her jeans. Haley clamped her legs shut, momentarily stemming the flow. Haley moaned in pain, as the brief release made letting the rest out all the more tantalizing. She bit her lip, tears welling up in her eyes. Haley knew this was the beginning of the end. A few seconds later, she let out a second, longer spurt, leaving streaks of urine running down the inseam of her jeans. As a final act of desperation, she jammed both hands between her legs, but it was no use. Haley squeezed her eyes shut and let out a stifled whimper.

A loud hiss filled the elevator, as her tormented bladder finally gave in. Her jeans began to glisten as urine exploded from her urethra, warmth spreading across her ass. Haley couldn’t help but let out an audible moan as relief washed over her and the contents of her bladder emptied themselves into her pants. Pee soaked her converse and began pooling on the floor. Finally, the stream began to slow. Oh my god, I fucking pissed my pants.

Haley slumped against the elevator wall, defeated.
