Horror Nights

On a cool Friday evening, a new thriller had just released, Stab 7, the most recent entry to the franchise. Marisa couldn’t wait to see it, she loved horror movies, she’s never really found them scary before though, always campy and fun. But she never liked going alone, something was missing just being the only one there. She asked her housemate Ellie if she wanted to go with her.

“Those movies are like gore fests aren’t they?”

“Yes”

“And you want me to go to that?”

“Yes please I promise it will be worth it in the end.”

Ellie reluctantly went with her, she’d never actually seen any of these movies before. A psycho killer in a mask out to kill a bunch of teenagers. She was fine with the premise it was just the horrifying visuals she wasn’t a fan of, and she’s with Miss Fearless today too so who knows how insane this is going to be.

The theater was dark, cool air filled the room. Marisa, her black hair tossed over one shoulder, lounged in the leather seat, her red jeans now feeling slightly tighter. She drank her soda with a grin, unfazed by the gore on screen. Ellie, beside her, glanced at her friend's nonchalance. "How are you not freaked out by this?" she whispered, her fingers digging into Marisa's thigh.

Marisa shruged, taking another sip of her drink. "I'm not a kid. This is just fun." Her leg began to jiggle slightly, the first hint of discomfort. She've been holding it since before the movie, and the large soda wasn't helping. She glanced down the aisle, the exit sign a solid red. She wouldn’t miss anything she thought just a quick trip to the bathroom.

"I'll be right back," she murmured, starting to rise.

Ellie's hand shot out, gripping her waist. "What? You scared?" Her eyes twinkled with mischief. "The great Marisa, freaking out over a movie? I knew you were lying just admit it!"

Marisa froze, her cheeks heating. "I'm not scared," she hissed. "I just need to pee."

Ellie leaned closer, her breath warm on Marisa's ear. "Ohh, but you’re not a kid right? You might miss the best part! Unless fearless Marisa could be scared?. How bad can it be?" Her tone was all singing tease, but there was a darker churn underneath.

Marisa swallowed, her tight jeans feeling more restrictive by the second as she crossed her legs. The pressure was building, a steady throb against her bladder. Even then she didn’t have to go that bad, she just need some relief, she could wait til the end of the movie she thought. She glanced at the screen, then at Ellie. "Fine," she grumbled. "But you can’t leave either.”

Ellie laughed, settling back. "I’m not the one pretending to be calm but deal."

The movie played on, the tension mounting. Marisa's fingers dug into the armrests, her legs quivering. The pressure was a throbbing pain, but nothing she couldn’t handle. She squirmed, her hips shifting for relief that wouldn't come. She was ultimately fine, she held it through much longer movies before. She involuntarily pressed her legs together and kept bouncing in her seat. Ellie’s words echoed in her head “You’re not a kid right?” Ironically being words she said earlier, but she was right she isn’t, she could handle it.

Marisa took a deep breath, relaxed herself briefly to assess the situation, she had to pee but wasn’t dying for it, her bladder was filling but not full. She was psyching herself out it was not that serious, the refusal of her freedom to pee whenever she wanted got her a bit worked up. She was in control, complete control.

But in a moment of relaxation she let her guard down.

The screen blazed with a rapid montage of grotesque faces, gory corpses, horrifying imagery the characters in the movie were witnessing, the sound of a scream piercing the air. Marisa jolted, her body launching forward. A horror trope seen all too often in modern cinema, a jump scare. Marisa had seen hundreds, possibly even thousands, of these over the years, but this time it was different. This time as her heart raced after jumping, she felt something else that wasn’t normal, a new sensation that didn’t register immediately.

A sudden warmth spread across her thighs, the material of her red jeans darkening as her piss seeped from her control. Creating a puddle on the leather seat and pouring into the crevices to the sides. Marisa pressed both hands into her crotch as if to stop it, bitting down on her quivering lip.

Ellie was completely oblivious to this until it started to trickle down Marisa’s legs and pour off the now lake of a seat onto the floor making a distinct dripping sound in a otherwise quiet theatre. Ellie tore her gaze away from the screen, looked around briefly and then she saw it. Her eyes widened. "Oh my god," she breathed. "Marisa... did you just...?"

Marisa couldn't speak. The horror of what just happened, possibly worse than any horror from the movie they were watching, a wet layer now cover her pants, creating a two tone look. Her hands still pressed into the wetness, the sting of humiliation deepening with every second. She was still going now as Ellie watched and felt the wetness spread, her skin burning with piss and shame. The jeans clung to her, extremely warm before eventually growing cold.

Ellie grasped her shoulder. "Oh my god, you peed yourself." Her voice was a mix of horror and delight yet still quiet enough for the theater to not be disrupted. "In the middle of the theater."

Marisa after emptying the contents of her bladder felt too embarrassed to feel relieved "I... I didn't mean to," she stammered, her voice broken. "It was an accident."

Ellie snickered, pulling out her phone. "This I have to send to Jenna. You actually got so scared you pissed yourself! She won't believe it."

Marisa grabbed her arm. "Please," she whispered, her eyes bright with tears. "Please don't. I'll do anything."

Ellie had a evil grin on her face “Anything?”

The lights came up, the movie over. Briefly startling Marisa, now her accident could be visible to passersby while leaving. She again tried to cover herself with her hands. “Yes anything!” She said to Ellie in a hushed tone. Marisa couldn't move. She felt some drops still splashing on the ground below her, she was still sitting in the puddle on the seat she had created, afraid moving would push it all off creating a sound that would alert others to look over.

Ellie standing, grinning. "Okay deal. I have a idea or two. Come on. We got to get out of here first."

Marisa’s face burning. She got up as slowly and carefully she could. Now standing it was clear how bad it was. The front of her pants were spared partially as it only ran to just above her knees. The inside of her thighs and the back however were completely soaked, there was no mistaking it. Her curves were now accented with shame that clung to her like glue. “I can’t walk out like this everyone will see!” Marisa pleaded.

Ellie thought for a second, “Well we could go out the side exit but then you’d have to walk across the whole parking lot.” Marisa didn’t care, at least it wouldnt be that obvious if people saw her from a distance. “Side exit. Now.” Is all she could muster. She walked out of the theater, her soaked jeans clinging to her, the sound of squishing fabric with every step, she’s now realizing her boots are filled with piss also making her cringe. Luckily one of the exits was very close and no one in the theater, as far as they could tell, saw her accident.

They walked to Ellie’s car, Ellie walked slightly behind Marisa as a way to “cover” her but it didn’t matter anyone who saw would know immediately. Ellie did however get a good look at how bad it really was, and she couldn’t resist taking a picture for posterity, just in case.

They reached the car, Marisa was about to sit down but Ellie stopped her. “Wait! You’re not sitting in her like that.” Marisa sighed, “Then what do you want me to do?” She responded.

Ellie, again with a smirk, said “Take off your shirt and sit on it, then it should at least stop from messing up my seats a bit.” Marisa didn’t even question it, she didn’t have the willpower right now, she did as she was asked. She took off her black t shirt, revealing her purple bra and place it on the seat. Finally she was able to sit down and close the door. She leaned back still teary eyed from the events. But Ellie wasn’t ready to let her forget it yet.

Ellie finally burst into laughter. "Oh my god, I can't believe you actually peed yourself." She doubled over, weezing. "In the middle of the movie! You act like Buffy but you can’t handle being scared at all!”

Marisa nails dug into her thighs "I…l..” she murmured, her voice shaking. "It just... hit me. The jump scare. And I couldn't ..." Her eyes darted to the floor, peering at the wet fabric of her jeans.

"That's hilarious." Ellie then pulled out her phone again. "Jenna's gonna die when she sees this. Wanna face time her?"

Marisa grabbed her wrist. "No, please," she whispered, her eyes wide. "I'll do anything you want."

Ellie, a slow, deliberate smile spreading across her face. "Oh trust me I heard you the first time." Her eyes darkened. "How about let me take a video of you now, just for me I won’t share it I promise."

Marisa's face burnt. "You wouldn't." Her voice was a faint.

Ellie laughed, “I just want something to commemorate the day fearless Marisa got a little to scared.”

Marisa looked down, waiting for this to be over. “Oh you need to say something too.” Ellie said jovially. She whispered to Marisa her script, and for her phone ready. Marisa knew she had to.

Ellie drove them home where Marisa sprinted to the bathroom as quick as possible. She took off her boots and poured the liquid in them down the drain in the shower her white socks now stained yellow after sitting in piss for about a hour. Everything except her bra was now soaked. She debated just throw them all out, it would be easier than worrying about them further. While cleaning up she dreaded what Ellie had next for her, but she’d do anything to keep her mouth shut.

Meanwhile Ellie laid in her bed watched her phone, laughing, a video of a shirtless Marisa hands pressed between her thighs shakily saying “I peed myself after getting scared from a movie.” Ending with a close up of her drenched pants. Ellie loved every second of it, she loved proving someone isn’t fearless and loved the plans she had for her next.
