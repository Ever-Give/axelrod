Sophia was a young police officer who had recently started her service. Her face was delicate and harmonious, with finely drawn features. She had large and expressive eyes, of an intense blue color that seemed to glow with its own light. Her eyebrows were thin and well-defined, and her nose was small and straight, contributing to giving her face an innocent but determined look. Her lips were full and rosy, with a smile that always seemed ready to illuminate her face.

Her physical appearance was very well-groomed and attractive. She had two large, round, and firm breasts that abundantly filled her uniform, highlighting her femininity. Her breasts were so prominent that they tended to jut out slightly forward, inevitably attracting attention. Her ass was equally impressive, toned and firm, with perfect curves that highlighted her figure. Even through the tight pants, one could notice her small and tight pussy, which seemed almost eager to emerge from the fabric, making the whole ensemble extremely sensual and provocative.

Sophia wore her uniform, which had been modified to fit her voluptuous body. The light blue jacket with the "POLICE" badge on the back and the tight blue pants highlighted every curve of her body, making her an imposing and authoritative presence. However, that night, her uniform would undergo an embarrassing and humiliating transformation.

It was a dark and muggy late summer night, and the city was wrapped in an almost unreal silence. Sophia, a young police officer, was on duty that night.

After several hours of patrolling the streets, Sophia felt an urgent need to use the bathroom. She had drunk too much coffee during her shift and was now paying the price. Initially, she tried to ignore the discomfort, thinking she could use the bathrooms at the station since she was almost done with her long shift. But as the minutes passed, the feeling became more and more urgent and unbearable. There was still an hour left in her shift, and Sophia realized she wouldn't make it to the station in time before wetting her pants. Soon after, her bladder started to really hurt, and she couldn't help but cross her legs while driving, with one hand pressing hard against her small and delicate pussy to avoid any leaks.

As Sophia drove the patrol car looking for an open diner or bathroom, which was difficult to find due to the time, her physical discomfort became more and more evident. The pressure in her bladder and the tension of the evening were having a visible effect on her body. She started to sweat profusely, with drops of sweat running down her forehead and gathering above her eyebrows. The armpits of her uniform, once impeccable, now showed evident dark stains and emitted a strong odor, a sign of her growing discomfort and anxiety.

Sweat trickled down her neck, soaking the collar of her jacket. Every movement seemed like a torment, with her skin itching and the wet fabric sticking to her. Sophia tried to ignore those sensations, focusing on the road and finding a place where she could finally relieve herself. But it was getting harder to keep calm. Her mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, between the fear of not finding a bathroom in time and the growing embarrassment of her physical state.

Finally, Sophia found an open diner. With a sigh of relief, she parked the car and quickly got out of the patrol car, heading towards the entrance. But at that very moment, the radio spoke, calling her to intervene and arrest a drug dealer at a block away from where she was. Sophia thought about not responding and running to the bathroom, but her sense of duty made her think. With a deep breath, she responded to the radio and started the car to intervene.

During the ride, the pressure in her bladder became extremely strong, making her eyes well up with tears. Some sprays of pee escaped between the lips of her pussy, wetting her fingers. Now, a dark stain the size of a tennis ball could be noticed in the center of her pants. Sophia clenched her teeth, trying to maintain control, but the pain and embarrassment were unbearable.

She arrived at the indicated location and slipped into the narrow alley, where she noticed the drug dealer. With trembling hands, she drew her taser with one hand, while the other was firmly and tightly pressed against her pussy, trembling with pain. "Stop, police! Surrender!" she ordered, trying to maintain an authoritative tone, but her voice trembled.

While Sophia was in the narrow alley, with the taser pointed at the drug dealer, the criminal immediately noticed her desperate state. The dark stain on her pants was evident, and the sweat running down her forehead and neck spoke clearly of her discomfort.

"Hey, cop, you seem a bit in trouble, huh?" the criminal said with a mocking smile. "Maybe you should go to the bathroom first, before trying to arrest someone. Unless you want to pee on yourself, of course."

Sophia, with tears streaming down her face, tried to maintain her composure. "Please, surrender. Don't make things harder!" she said with a trembling voice.

The criminal laughed, a cruel sound that echoed in the alley. "Harder? For you, or for me? You look like you're about to explode, cop. You wouldn't want to wet your pretty pants, would you? Or maybe it's already too late?"

Sophia felt another wave of urgent need. Her aching bladder pulsed strongly against her clothes, and she couldn't help but lose more fluid, widening the dark stain on her pants even more. Tears streamed down her face as humiliation overwhelmed her. "Oh, look at that, our cop has decided to give a nice gift to the sidewalk," the criminal continued, laughing. "Don't worry, it's not the first time I've seen a woman lose control. But it usually doesn't happen to a cop, huh?"

Sophia, with a broken heart, tried to stay calm. "Please, surrender. I don't want to hurt you," she said, her voice broken by sobs. The criminal, seeing her weakness, decided to take advantage of it. "Oh, don't worry about me, cop. Worry about yourself. You look like you're about to faint. Maybe you should sit down and relax a bit."

Just as the criminal was speaking, he took a step forward, ready to jump on Sophia. With her heart in her throat, Sophia managed to react in time, shooting with the taser. The dart hit the criminal, immobilizing him instantly. But due to the fright and adrenaline, Sophia completely lost control of her bladder, starting to pee with full force in her blue pants. The urine soaked the pants completely, making them glossy and stinky.

As Sophia collapsed to the ground, sobbing from humiliation and pain, she heard the sound of sirens approaching. Reinforcements were arriving, and with them, a new wave of embarrassment. The police cars stopped with a screech of tires, and several officers got out, immediately noticing Sophia's state.

"Hey, what the hell happened to you?" one of the officers asked, covering his nose from the strong smell of urine. "Did you pee yourself?"

The other officers laughed, pointing at Sophia. "Look at you, Sophia. You look like a disaster!"

Sophia, with her cheeks on fire, tried to get up, but her legs were trembling too much. "Please, stop it" she said with a trembling voice. "It was an accident."

But her colleagues showed no pity. "An accident?" another said, with a tone of derision in his voice. "Or maybe it's just a girl who can't control herself?"

Just then, a crowd of journalists approached, attracted by the scene. With microphones and cameras pointed at her, Sophia felt even more humiliated. The journalists immediately noticed her state and started asking her questions, without any regard for her situation.

"Officer, can you tell us what happened?" one of the journalists asked, with a tone of voice that betrayed his excitement for the scoop.

Sophia, with tears streaming down her face, tried to stay calm. "I... I was chasing a suspect" she stammered, her voice trembling. "And... and I had an accident."

The journalists continued to ask her questions, ignoring her obvious discomfort. "An accident? Can you explain it to us better?" another asked, with a mocking smile.

Sophia felt her face flush with embarrassment. "Please, don't laugh at me" she said with a quivering voice. "It was an accident."

But the journalists showed no pity. "An accident?" one of them said, with a tone of derision in his voice. "How can a girl piss herself defend us from criminals?"

Sophia felt her heart break. She realized there was nothing she could do to stop their laughter and cruel jokes. With tears streaming down her face, she tried to maintain her composure, but it was too much. She started to sob, unable to control her emotions. And as she cried, she felt another wave of urgent need. With her bladder now tired, Sophia covered her face, unable to hold back. The pee left in her bladder came out with full force from her small pussy, re-soaking her pants in a few seconds. The smell of urine was unbearable, and Sophia felt tears stream down her face as she realized the further humiliation.

The journalists, noticing her state, continued to film, capturing every moment of her agony. "What a mess, look at how you've reduced yourself" one of them said, covering his nose.

From that day on, Sophia will be called by her station and her acquaintances as "the pee cop" significantly damaging the career of the young police officer.
