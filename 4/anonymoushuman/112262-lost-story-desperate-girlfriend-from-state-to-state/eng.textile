Hey all. Does anyone have copies of Harwood's masterpiece stories - 'Desperate girlfriend from state to state' or 'Desperate girlfiend after the Moomba Festival' they could share with me? The stories were deleted about a year ago and were absolutely the best I've ever read. I've been trying to track down copies.
