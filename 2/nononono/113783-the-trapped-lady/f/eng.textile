"Ez, please stop here, I'm about to wee myself," Annie moaned, the seatbelt viciously digging into her swollen bladder.

"Okay okay, I'm dying for a piss too," Ez admitted, after four hours driving with no breaks and plenty of water.

Ez parked the car, almost forgetting to apply the handbrake, such was the urgency of their situation. The Trapped Lady was to be the location of their relief, a quaint English pub in the middle of nowhere. The two best friends were only ten minutes away from the campsite they'd booked to spend the May bank holiday weekend in, but they could wait no longer. Every step closer to salvation felt that little bit more difficult, as they felt the full weight of the recycled water, coffee and Diet Coke begging for release. Annie had been desperate to pee since Stonehenge, almost an hour and a half ago. She would have brought up her need sooner, but Ez had made it very clear she only wanted to stop in an emergency.

After an hour of constantly crossing and recrossing her legs, desperately contorting herself in any way to feel comfortable, Annie admitted her dilemma. Ez, stubborn as ever, told her to hold it, in spite of her own situation. But even Ez's monster bladder had reached its limits, and she knew if she didn't stop there and then, she'd have to pay to get her car seat cleaned.

The Trapped Lady was exactly how you'd expect. A dingy pub, with only a handful of locals sipping their ales, all of whom could barely keep their eyes off of the two pretty 20-somethings who stumbled in, clutching their crotches for dear life. The barman, a balding bloke in his 60s, looked baffled as Annie and Ez walked towards him, their eyes darting around desperately.

"Where's your loo? I promise we'll buy something," Ez bounced up and down on the spot, as if to prove her desperation was genuine. She noticed him staring at her tits as they bounced up and down, but her situation was too dire to bring it up.

"Through that door and on the right," the barman pointed.

"Thank you thank you thank you," Annie squealed, a drop of wee escaping into her panties as she did this.

'Fuck, there's only one toilet," Ez exclaimed as she flung the door open.

"Please let me go first, I'm absolutely bursting," Annie felt another drop leak out.

"Me too, plus I drank more coffee than you," Ez protested.

"You and me both know you've got a stronger bladder than me," Annie had now positioned herself so she was closer to the toilet. "I promise I'll be quick!"

And with that, Annie had locked the door. Ez heard the desperate sounds of Annie fumbling with her belt, before the brunette finally freed herself, yanking down her knickers and releasing a torrent of urine into the bowl. Ez tried to block out all the noise: the moans, the hiss, the steady stream of water trickling into the water below. She gasped as her normally robust bladder threatened to let her down, a small spurt of pee escaping into her previously pristine purple panties. Looking up, she noticed a quaint toilet door sign, the sort you often saw in this type of pub. The sign looked like a picture from a Victorian children's book, showing a young woman clutching herself, as if desperate for the loo. Ez may well have been looking in a mirror, the lady in the sign even having blonde hair and a look of distress to match.

"Annie, hurry up. I'm literally going to piss myself," Ez groaned.

Good god, Annie could pee. Annie was the sort of person who'd ask to stop at every motorway service station so she could pee. Annie was the sort of person who'd pissed in every alleyway during her time at university. Annie was the sort of person who wet themselves on Nemesis Inferno when she was 21 and still hasn't quite lived it down.

Whereas Ez was the sort of person who used to go entire days without peeing at school just to avoid the bathrooms. Ez was the sort of person who'd look after everyone's coats and bags whilst they went to use the toilet. Ez was the sort of person who once gave herself a UTI after holding it in for 12 hours to win a bet with her twin sister.

The stream finally slowed down, just as Ez was considering using the men's. Another leak escaped as she tried to stand up straight. She'd not needed the loo this badly since winning Â£20 from her sister for holding it all day. She bounced on the spot, now literally jamming her left hand to ease the pressure on her pee hole, as another intense wave of desperation hit her. A hot trickle of urine seeped through her panties as she heard the toilet flush.

"OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!" Ez yelled.

The door unlocked and Ez bolted to the loo, sat down and let loose. Such was her relief she didn't notice the door was wide open. Such was her relief that she didn't notice she'd failed to pull her knickers down.

"Annie, the door," she hissed, as her friend washed her hands, still in a euphoric state of post-wee bliss.

"Sorry," Annie blushed. Ez looked like she was about to cum as what felt like litres exited her body. She didn't care that her panties were now drenched. Annie pretended not to notice the moans she let out.

"Fuck. Me." Ez exclaimed as she finally finished her piss. She stood up, holding her skirt up to show Annie her soaked panties. "Guess these will have to go." Annie turned away, but couldn't help but glimpse Ez in the mirror, peeling off her knickers, revealing her shaved pussy. Annie had always assumed she was more of a 'free the bush' kind of person, but she couldn't quite articulate why. Ez disposed of her panties in the bin, and pulled her skirt down.

"Right!" Ez clapped her hands together. "I need a pint."

It was a bitterly cold January. The sort of cold that only mad people would venture out in. Holly and Jack were those mad people. The sun was out for the first time that year, so the two were determined to make a day of it. The two lovers had been for a Sunday roast at the Black Bull, and were now walking along the moors to a new pub that had just opened, The Trapped Lady. The walk was about three hours long, but they were determined to make the most of the sunshine. After all, they both quit their high flying jobs in the city to spend more time in nature. Two hours into the walk, the laughing and cuddling had turned into prolonged silences and impatience.

"How much further Jacky?" Holly asked, a hint of frustration in her voice.

"Erm, about an hour I think," he replied, trying to make sense of the Ordinance Survey map in front of him.

"Urgh," Holly moaned, rolling her eyes.

"What's up?" Jack asked.

"I just... I should have weed before we left the pub," Holly admitted, blushing slightly.

Jack laughed "Classic!"

"Jack!" Holly jokingly shoved him. "I'm serious, I'm desperate for a piss."

"Go on then," Jack gestured to the moors. "Nature's toilet."

Holly bit her lip and bounced slightly as she looked around. "No I can't, it's too cold."

"Are you sure?" Jack asked. "Still a while to go."

"I'll hold it," Holly replied, unconvincingly.

The two continued on their walk, Holly trying to keep the conversation going to distract herself from the growing pressure in her bladder. But the beer from lunch, plus the water she'd drunk on the walk was starting to become a more serious issue.

"Jack, where even is this pub? I swear it's been an hour now," Holly asked.

"Yeah, erm, so I think we made a wrong turning," he muttered.

Holly raised an eyebrow "You mean you led us the wrong way?"

"It does seem that way, yes," Jack sheepishly admitted.

"Fucking hell Jack," she hissed.

"What's your problem?" he asked.

"I'm absolutely dying for a wee," she cried, fighting back tears.

"Okay, so just go here. I can keep guard," he suggested.

"It's so cold Jacky, I swear my bum will get frostbite," she replied, clutching her pussy in desperation.

"It'll take like one minute," Jack tried to reason.

"No," she snapped. "I can hold it. Just, let's pick up the pace a bit."

###

An hour passed. The sun had now set, and Holly was on the brink. Every step was now a test for her bladder. The two hadn't spoken properly for half an hour, bar Holly vocalising her desperation.

"God, I am in AGONY," Holly cried.

"Look, there's the pub!" Jack exclaimed.

"Fucking finally," she sighed. "My bladder is about to burst."

The thought of relief was almost too much for Holly and she had to clench everything to avoid wetting her jeans right there and there. She gasped as a spurt of wee leaked out, running down her leg.

"Oh god, I'm about to piss myself," she cried.

"Just a bit further," Jack promised.

"I've never needed a wee this badly in my life," she cried.

"I did tell you to piss before we..."

"Not the fucking time," she yelled, as another drop leaked out.

Jack reached the door "Oh shit."

"What??" Holly shouted, bent over and clutching herself for dear life.

"We have a slight problem," Jack pushed the locked door to demonstrate. "It doesn't open till tomorrow. I must have misread the dates."

"You're a fucking idiot," Holly was practically screaming. "But I can't hold on any longer, I'm absolutely bursting."

"Look, there's no one else around," Jack checked his surroundings. "Just go here."

Holly reluctantly accepted her fate. "I guess I have no choice."

"I'll keep watch," Jack answered, as Holly went to seek her relief.

Round the corner of the pub, Holly unbuttoned her jeans, a tsunami of urine ready to leave her bladder. As she started to pull her panties down, a voice cried out.

"I wouldn't do that if I were you," a deep voice cried out.

"Jack, fuck off," she moaned.

"Were you about to defile this building?" the voice moved closer, and Holly became aware of a shadowy figure walking towards her.

"Look mate, I'm sorry but I'm about to explode," she cried, pulling her panties and jeans up.

A strange green glow appeared around Holly, the shadowy figure now inches away from her face. The pressure in her bladder was unbearable at this point. She knew she had no choice but to wet herself. She closed her eyes and tried to relax. Nothing. Fear engulfed her.

"Okay, look don't worry. I'll go somewhere else," she tried to move but found her legs were frozen to the spot. Every fight or flight instinct was trying to release her bladder, and yet not even a drop leaked out. "Please, help me!"

"This is a sacred spot, you really shouldn't be urinating here," the voice whispered. Holly looked at the figure but could not make out a face. She tried again to pee, but nothing came out. Her bladder felt like it was on fire.

"I wasn't... I won't, please, where's Jack?" she begged.

"Don't worry, I'll make sure there's no risk of you urinating on yourself or this building ever again," the figure proclaimed, as he lifted up what looked like a magic wand.

And with one swish, Holly was no more.
