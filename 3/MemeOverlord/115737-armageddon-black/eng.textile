(I have been working on a novel for some time now. Though it is not explicitly about omo, me being me, I had to put some omo scenes in the story. This is only a rough draft with some concept pictures, but I have added a little extra omo into it for you all and shared here.)

Prologue

England 1351

The sky was black with smoke as Sir Roderick doggedly ran down the muddy street. The taste of afflicted burning flesh was so thick in the air that he could barely breath as he ran. The Knight had fled from the forest to this village of Ashbury, hoping to find refuge from his pursuers. But alas, the village was already derelict from the plague, the only remaining inhabitants now lined the streets as smoldering corpses.

Sir Roderick squinted his eyes and peered through the smut in the sky, he could see that dusk was already upon him. The whoops and screeches of the night beasts and demons could be heard approaching from the forest to the South. To the North of the village was naught but an open field, Roderick knew that he would never make it that way. Unleashed now by the lack of sunlight, the unburdened night beasts would quickly run him down in the open. His only chance now was to hide in one of the abandoned dwellings.

Upon deciding to hide, Sir Roderick brought his muddied greaves to a clanking halt in the muck of the street, and made a sharp right towards the nearest door. He slammed an armored shoulder into the heavy wood of the door, forcing it open. Once inside, the exhausted Knight quickly closed and barred the door. He was instantly assaulted by a stench even more ungodly than the reek of the streets. The festering stink was a scent that he was all too familiar with by now, rotting bodies. The dead of this house had not been brought out, but rather were left to rot where they died. The still air of the small house was heavy and suffocating, Sir Roderick instantly felt ill, and thought he may cast vomit.

Laying on the floor amongst the bodies and other refuse, Sir Roderick attempted to catch his breath in this rancid air. Now that there was a moment of calm, the dread began to set in as he recalled the events that just transpired. He and his men-at-arms were trapsing through the forest on an endeavor to hunt rogue night beasts that had been prowling the area. And then it all went wrong. A small horde of night beasts commanded by their demon masters descended upon he and his men in a coordinated strike. Though Sir Roderick slew may of the hellish creatures, his men were outnumbered and quickly defeated, forcing him to retreat as the only survivor. And now that same horde was upon his heels, he could hear them approaching from out in the street. He clutched his sword close to his body, and prepared for whatever end was to come.

The horde had stopped in front of the house where Sir Roderick was hiding, but now they stood still. No more screeching or cackling, just silence. He could feel his heart pounding while he waited for their next move. Every second felt like an eternity as he waited, until the door abruptly exploded into splinters and an unnatural black mist entered the room. Instead of some savage beast rushing into the room, the doorway was now filled with the tall frame of a man, hooded and cloaked. Slowly the figure glided into the room and outstretched both hands, causing the black mist to stop billowing, and instantly drop to the floor as if a thick carpet. As the man's sleeves slid back, a pair of gnarled and scarred hands were revealed, they had small blades and other demonic totems woven into the crippled flesh. With a twisted finger, the man reached up and pulled his hood down from his head, showing a human face with a lower jaw that was equally scarred and distorted as his hands.

Sir Roderick's eyes widened in recognition, "Y-you, you're the Harbinger!?"

The Harbinger only regarded his prey with a cold silence.

"W-wait, all of the others from the order are already dead! A-and you've slain all of my men now too. Can you not let me go? I will oppose you no longer!!"

In a flash, the Harbinger produced a sword from the sleeve of his robe and was upon Sir Roderick. The Knight fought back to defend himself, but was quickly overpowered by the inhuman speed, and the long reach of the Harbinger's large frame.

Sir Roderick now found himself disarmed, and on the ground as he was being dragged by the collar of his gorget into the center of the dead village. He attempted to look over his shoulder, and around the Harbinger's cloak to see where he was being taken, but he could not see. A few moments later, the Harbinger spun around and tossed the Knight face first into the mud of the town square. He knew this was the end of his road, and thus, he stalled looking up, and savored his refuge in the cold mud.

The Harbinger reached down and wove his petulant fingers through Sir Roderick's ruddy brown hair, grabbing a handful and forcing him to look up. The man let out a gasp of fear as he saw what was before him; they had erected a large, upside down cross in the center of the street, the beasts were drooling, and the demons were holding torches. He now knew what his fate would be.

Chapter 1

Master and Servant

(Three years earlier)

England 1348

"No, please! NO MORE!" the woman screamed.

A short, stocky man looked down at her, "Well?" He said, impatiently as he released the calipers from her fingernail. The young woman was a sobbing, bruised mess. Blood and urine streaked her legs and was pooled upon the stone floor at her feet.

"...I-I will tell you." She finally stammered with a whimper.

Slamming the door behind him, a lone Knight exited the cellar that made as the dungeon for the commandery where the Knights operated from. Sir Richard the Tall he was known to be called by most. He was a tall man of lean muscle and dark hair, not yet upon his thirtieth year. He was clad in chainmail, with a suit of plate armor over top. In addition, he wore a white surcoat, and carried a shield bearing the sigil of his order a red cross overlaid with a whie scallop.

Sir Richard wrapped his travel cloak about him upon exiting the subterranean structure; the cold wind and clear air of an English Autumn were a stark contrast to the stench of blood and bodily fluids from the makeshift prison. He could still hear the screams of the witch ringing in his ears as he left Brother Paxton to finish his work in the dungeon. He had an ill-favored disposition about his new duty. After the army was recalled from the war due to the rampant plague, he now spent his days with the other Knights of his order hunting and torturing witches, heretics, cultists and others who consorted with demons.

He found it easy to steele his heart and fight for his king, and the path was clear when a demon was before him needing to be slain, but it was harder to feel fulfilled from torturing a woman, but it had to be done, and he was indeed truly sickened by those who practiced witchcraft and the like. He wished it were not so, but looking the other way and letting the poor girl go was not an option, they had caught her red-handed in the middle of a demonic summoning ritual. He was devote in his duty, and willing to do whatever needed in order to stop this Satanic plague.

"Come lads, we have our lead." Richard said in a clear, succinct tone that most had come to expect of the man, as he approached several of his men-at-arms; he typically only ever said what he needed, and little more.

"Aye, Sir." One of them responded.

After a few minutes in the commandery arms room, and stables, the group was off. Four men upon Horseback heading North that chilly morning. By mid-day, they had finally reached their destination, a seemingly abandoned windmill stead on the lonely countryside. This sad collection of structures had come to be known as, Bleakwind Mills by most of the locals, who avoided the area. It was the perfect place to hide cultist activity.

Sir Richard tugged on the reins of his steed and beckoned his troupe to halt. Staying mounted in the saddle, he slowly surveyed the area. The broken-down mills and dilapidated housings certainly were bleak, as their namesake would suggest. The stead was made up of two store houses and a large stone mill on the near side, then the remnants of a crop field from times long past in the center, then several small houses and another stone windmill on the opposite side. There were no signs of life anywhere, and yet, he could feel that he was in the right place. There was a malignant ill-will hanging in the air.

"This is the right place, Lads." Richard said to his men.

The armor-clad knight swung down from his saddle, hitting the ground with a clank. His men followed suit and gathered around him, awaiting instructions.

"What is the plan, Boss?" one of them asked.

"We will split into groups of two and search each building." he responded, "You two will search the far side, and you will be with me on this side of the stead." he said, as he pointed at the respective men.

The two groups split and headed to the opposite ends of the complex. There were more than a few derelict buildings to search, so Richard began with the one nearest to him, a small store house. After a near half-hour of searching, he had checked all three buildings on his side, and turned up nothing out of the ordinary, just empty buildings filled with weeds, animal droppings and decayed furnishings. So, he and his man headed out across the withered crop field towards the remaining buildings on the other side.

As they were nearing the halfway mark, the silence was suddenly shattered by a guttural scream coming from the direction of the far side housings. Sir Richard and his Soldier paused in their tracks to exchange glances. Richard shouted only one word, "MOVE!!" and began sprinting towards the houses, his armor clanking against itself as he moved. Despite wearing less armor, the other man struggled to keep up with Sir Richard as they raced across the field.

Upon reaching the houses, Sir Richard stopped and listened; all was silent now, say for the panting of his Soldier struggling to catch up and catch his breath. There was not much to be seen of these buildings, as the doors and roofs had mostly rotted away, leaving only walls and stone floors. In the largest of the houses, there could be seen signs of a struggle: scuffed floors, kicked up leaves, and some splattering of blood. Clearly his other two men had encountered trouble, and he was unable to hear the din of the skirmish from within the buildings on the other side. "Here." he breathed quietly as he pointed towards a cellar entrance cut into the stone of the main chamber in the house. "Quickly, get your lantern lit." He instructed under his breath. The two men descended below, each armed with a lantern in one hand, and a sword in the other.

The stairs brought them to an underground stone corridor. In the dim light of his lantern, Sir Richard could just barely make out the traces of blood smeared along the floor, as if someone had been dragged along whilst bleeding. The passageway eventually took a sharp turn and then let out into a stone chamber no larger than that of a bedroom. Strewn about the floor were the corpses of what appeared to be three cultists. They were clad in naught but simple robes, and armed only with daggers, it came as no surprise that his men were able to overcome these adversaries, though there was still no sign of them. On the far end of the chamber, some of the stones of the wall had been cleared away to reveal a doorway dug into the soil and leading deeper underground. Sir Richard beckoned to his man to follow as he stepped over the corpses and entered the crude earthen descent.

Delving deeper, the two were finally able to make out a feint light coming from further down the passage. Cautiously, they approached the light, and entered a chamber carved into the earth. The chamber was cluttered with lit candles all about the floor, the ceiling supports had many wicker carvings and bone effigies hanging from them, and in the center, dangling from two chains, were the flayed bodies of Sir Richard's other two men. They were naked and disemboweled, with the skin of their stomachs and chest stretched and splayed outward by hooks.

The two men gasped at this sight and quickly traced the outline of a crucifix upon their chests. "Lord, deliver us from this evil." Sir Richard muttered in prayer as he continued on to the next chamber. Soon, they entered another stone area, via another crudely made entryway. Richard reckoned that they were now underneath the second mill, within its basement. Within this chamber, there were a few sconces upon the walls, providing some modicum of visibility. Here there were many barrels, crates and other such supplies stacked about the area, clearly the cultists were living here.

A fell green light was coming from a side room in the chamber, as well, Sir Richard's nose was assaulted by the stench of sulphur. He and his man-at-arms both extinguished their lanterns, and recovered their shields which they had slung across their backs and headed towards the room. They hid behind a stack of supplies and peered deeper into the side room. Within, they could see two cultists kneeled next to a pentagram that had been crudely etched onto the stone floor, they were praying and chanting fervently. Suddenly, the pentagram turned into a solid ebony circle, as black mist rolled out from within, and hues of red and green danced and flickered upon the walls.

"Please, oh great and mighty Astaroth, grant us one of your intrepid servants!" one of the cultists chanted.

"We vow to serve you!" the other called.

It was difficult for him to see, but Sir Richard could make out the black silhouette of a small figure rising from the floor. He gripped the hilt of his sword tightly, as he mentally prepared. He knew that he had to strike quickly, else even more demons be summoned, thus making the fight all the more dangerous.

"Blimey! What's this one?!" The cultist on the left complained, "We got a runt, nothing but an imp!"

"It is fine, dear brother." The other responded in a calm, monotone voice. "She is a gift from the Great one, and she is to be used to fulfill our other needs."

"ENOUGH!!" Sir Richard bellowed as he leapt from cover, brandishing his sword and confronted the pair of cultists crowded around the dark figure.

"Servant of Astaroth, deliver us from this unbeliever!" the monotoned man commanded with a pointed finger.

Unbeknownst to him, another demon had been hiding nearby as it seemingly materialized out of the shadows in the corner of the room before Sir Richard. The grand demon stood nearly eight feet tall, its body was naked and that of a man with red skin, its hands were adorned with long black claws, still dripping with the blood of Sir Richard's comrades. The head of the creature was entirely unhuman and appeared to be more akin to a fanged horse or cow skull with horns and fiery red eyes glaring from the sockets. It's horns grazed the ceiling of the chamber as it looked down at the man and roared. In quick succession, the demon swung either hand at Richard in an attempt to cut him down where he stood, but he was a fine swordsman, and managed to parry the dagger-like claws with his sword.

"Hold fast, M'Lord! You do not fight alone!" Sir Richard's man called as he joined the fight.

The man approached the great demon from the side, thinking he had caught it off guard while it was busy fighting the knight. He was wrong. The demon's arm contorted backwards in a movement that would deny any normal human sinew, and sliced the man's throat open in one fell swoop. With blood pouring from his neck, Sir Richard's Soldier fell to his knees and quickly expired upon the cold stone floor.

"Damn you to hell, daemon!" Richard shouted as he charged the beast. With his shield he parried its right hand, and with his sword, the other, thus making an opening in the demon's defenses. Making use of the opening, he thrust his sword into the demon's chest and ran it through, pushing it against the far wall as he did so. The demon roared in pain and reached down, plunging it's claws into the sturdy steel of Sir Richard's pauldrons in a final attempt to kill it's adversary. But, to no avail, the armor protected the knight, and the demon quickly perished from its wound. The cultists were upon Sir Richard in an instant, before he had even finished withdrawing his sword from the breast of the demon.

With his free arm, Richard swung his shield backwards, towards the nearest cultist, striking his daggered hand with a sickening crunch. The bones of the enemy's hand were shattered, and he dropped the dagger to the floor. Raising his shield higher, Richard blocked the strike from the other cultists who had made it in close, and then kicked the man in the unprotected belly with all the strength he could muster. This quickly sent the second cultist rolling backwards onto the ground, giving Sir Richard enough time to finish pulling his sword from the slain demon and cut down the first cultist with the broken hand. The second cultist rolled over onto his stomach and attempted to crawl away on all fours. Sir Richard took a few steps closer, and slammed a greaved boot upon the hem of the cultist's robe, stopping his retreat.

"May God have mercy upon your rotten soul." he said as he drove his sword into the back of the prostrate man.

A stirring in the corner of the room brought Sir Richard's attention back to the other demon that was being summoned, which he had nearly forgotten, as it had not joined the fight. He readied his sword and lurched towards the figure hiding in the shadowy corner. He stopped dead in his tracks as the figure revealed herself from the shadows. Richard's eyes met with a pair of green eyes belonging to a frightened young girl. Her frame was slender, and her stature short, barely reaching above his stomach. Her hair was raven black and shimmered purple when caught by the light, and adorned with bows and ribbons. Her body was sparsely clad in black satin and hosiery which clung to her delicate extremities.

"Surely THIS could not be the daemon which they had summoned?" Sir Richard thought to himself, "A slave girl, perhaps?" As she stepped further into the light, he noticed more, she had a small pair of wings protruding from her uncovered back, and what appeared to be a pointy tail just above her buttocks. This girl was in fact some sort of demon, he reasoned, as he raised his blade again.

Seeing the raised blade, the girl whimpered, "Y-you saved me?...Master?"

Chapter 2

The Girl

It was still daylight, as Sir Richard trekked along the road back from where he had come. At some point, during his time underground fighting the demonic forces, something had spooked the horses and sent them running. Now he was forced to return on foot. As he marched, Sir Richard contemplated what had just transpired. After losing his comrades, and defeating his foes, he had met this demon girl, or succubus as he had taken to calling her. His creed mandated that he slay her upon first sight, but somehow, he just couldn't bring himself to do it, she was just so...so human. Upon first seeing her gaze, and hearing her soft, frightened voice, he was reminded of a young girl who was close to him. Something deep in his gut restrained him from intentionally bringing harm to her, despite his disgust of her.

Sir Richard was jostled away from his musings by the wailing of the demon girl.

"Master, it hurts! My skin cannot handle the direct sunlight!" She cried, "Please take me away from here! Please shelter meee!"

She had been going on like this and tugging at the metal collar and chain leash that Sir Richard had affixed to her neck for the last hour or so, ever since they had departed the Bleakwind Mills.

"Silence, Girl!" he shouted contemptuously, "There is a recently abandoned stead not far from here. We may rest there till you belay your whining!"

In short order, the pair arrived at the abandoned dwelling. The house was still in good condition and furnished, as it had only recently been left by a family fleeing elsewhere from the plague. Sir Richard threw the door open, and jerked the girl's chain, pulling her inside the shade of the interior.

"Th-thank you, Master." the girl panted, "Again, I owe my being to you and your kindness."

"And again, Girl, I tell you to be silent!" Sir Richard retorted. "You are naught but a succubus sent to lure me away from the light, are you not? And do not call me, 'Master,' understood?"

"But what then shall I call my protector?"

"Nothing! You shall not speak to me any further on this journey. Keep your seducing words to yourself."

With a defeated sigh, the girl meekly nodded her head and withdrew further away from the knight. Sir Richard lead the girl over to the far corner of the room, and secured her leash there, then went about starting a fire in the hearth.

"Girl, you will not start crying and wailing again if I light this fire?" he asked. "Just from the sun, correct?'

She shook her head and indicated that it would be fine. Once the fire was lit, Richard sat upon a stool next to the hearth with his back to the wall so that he could watch the girl in the opposite corner. He did not trust her, but his body screamed for rest. Killing your fellow man was an exhausting task, as was preserving one's own life. As he sat there, arms crossed and gazing broodingly from the slits of his helmet visor, he gradually began to lose the battle of sleep and started to drift off. Being whisked away to the land of dreams, Sir Richard entered a fitful sleep as he dreamt of his past and better times long since lost.

Sir Richard was abruptly awoken from his troubled dreams by the scream of the young demon girl. He shot upright from his sleep so quickly the his stool tipped over, and he tumbled to the floor, only to see the hooded visage of a cloaked cultist descending upon him. He reached for his sword, but it had fallen away from him when his stool turned over. The enemy was already upon him then, with a dirk in hand. Richard was forced to grab the man's wrist instead of reaching for his own sword, in order to stop the hooded adversary from plunging the blade into his throat. There were two other men wearing the typical dark, hooded habits of the cultists over in the other corner of the room. One was holding the girl down by her arms, and the other was struggling with her kicking legs.

A great demon then entered the dwelling. This one had the same appearance as the one Sir Richard had encountered at the Bleakwind Mills, however its frame was even more muscular and twisted, with strange horn-like growths protruding from its back and elbows. The behemoth lumbered over to the two cultists in the corner and pulled them off of the girl.

"Hands off, worms!" it said in a gravelly voice, "this little thing is MINE!"

"What do you think you are doing?" one of the cultists replied. "I summoned you; I am your master!"

"Is that so?" it retorted with a wicked grin. With the palm of its hand, the demon slammed the man's head into the wall, popping it like a fat tick. "I know the will of the great Astaroth the same as you do, if not more so. I will not take orders from the likes of you! Now leave me to it."

The other cultist backed away and watched from a distance. The girl squealed and tugged at her chain, attempting to get away. The demon chuckled and grabbed her by one wrist, lifting her off the ground. She shrieked in pain from its vice-like grip. The demon licked the boney fangs that served as its lips in mirth at the girl's struggle.

"M-Master! Help!!" the girl screamed.

Through his struggle, Sir Richard looked over the shoulder of the cultist ontop of him and saw the girl in the clutches of the lustful demon. In that moment, a flash of a memory awoke within him and all he could see was red.

"AMELIA!!" he screamed in a rage.

Sir Richard released the cultists wrist, allowing the man's blade to come downward, lacerating his arm and getting tangled in his chainmail. Had the man been expecting Richard to let go, he may have been able to land a more precise blow. The knight did not even notice the minor wound, with his hand now free, he bashed the cultists skull with his gauntlet, sending him sprawling to the ground. In an instant, Richard was on top of the man, repeatedly punching his face with his armored hands until the man was no longer recognizable as human. In nearly a single bound, he leapt across the room, tackling the other cultist to the ground. With both hands wrapped around the man's neck, he squeezed with every ounce of strength, whilst also banging his head into the floor until the cultist stopped struggling and lay there dead. Richard reached for the nearest object to him, a wooden chair, and sprung back to his feet.

He reached high and swung the chair into the back of the large demon's head, shattering the wood and causing the demon to fall against the wall. As the demon leaned against the wall in a state of disorientation, Sir Richard took the only part of the chair still remaining in his hand, a single leg, and plunged the jagged end into the demon's shoulder blade. He used his body weight to drive the chair leg into the demon's flesh, thus causing it to fall to its hands and knees. Not missing his chance, the knight clung to the demon's back, and wrapped an armored arm around it's neck, crushing its windpipe. The demon gasped and roared as it attempted to reach behind its own back and claw at Richard, but the beast's arms were too large and deformed to do so with any threatening force, so it's dagger claws merely clanked off of the armor. Finally, after a long struggle, the demon fell face-forward onto the floor, gurgling as it died.

Slowly, Sir Richard stood to his feet, his body still quivering with rage. As he looked over at the demon girl, he could no longer find it in his heart to despise her, he felt only pity for the poor thing. With tears running down her face, she had sunk to her knees, in a puddle of her own making. She was still shaking with fear as she sobbed.

&&

"Surely this girl was no monster" he thought to himself. "She looks more akin to a crying child than a demonic seductress. Surely she must not be my enemy if she suffers such abuses by the same demons that are my enemies."

Silently, he reached over and removed the shackle from her neck, and offered his hand to her. Wiping away some tears, the girl gingerly took his hand, and allowed him to help her up to her unsteady feet. Sir Richard found a basin, and began heating some water by the fire for the girl. He helped her into the basin so that she could bathe, soiled clothing and all.

"I am sorry Master." she said whilst still in the basin, after much silence.

"Sorry for what?" he replied, after a pause.

"I know you were already disgusted by me, Master. And now...this."

"No, it is...fine." he said, looking away abashedly.

Already, it had grown late, so Sir Richard elected to stay there for the night, rather than risking open travel in the dark, if more demons were hunting them. The girl went to lay on a bedroll on the far side of the house. As she lay there, shivering, Richard beckoned her to come by the fire instead.

"It is alright, Girl. You need not distance yourself anymore."

Laying on her bedroll, next to the warm hearth, she was fast asleep, but still occasionally shivering. Feeling pity once more, Richard removed his cloak, and wrapped it about her as she slept. With sword in hand, he stood watch by the door till morn.

As dawn approached, Sir Richard shook the girl awake, and bade her that it was time to leave. She looked about her body in surprise to see that she was being kept warm by her protector's cloak; this brought a shy smile to her face. She offered the cloak back to him.

"Nay, keep it and cover that sinful body of yours." he replied, sternly. "...will you not need it to protect yourself from the sunlight?"

"Thank you master." she said sweetly.

The knight merely nodded in acknowledgement of her thanks and headed out the door. Before long, the sun was overhead, but his hooded cloak was sufficient to protect the demon girl's porcelain skin. Throughout the night, Sir Richard had spent much time in contemplation, and resolved himself to steele his heart and not give sway to anymore of the girl's innocent charm. And yet, every time she spoke, her angelic voice softened his heart and forced him to respond in due order.

"Um...Master?...may I ask you a question?" the girl inquired as they walked along the beaten path.

"Very well, Girl. What is it?"

She fidgeted and looked down at her feet, "Who is that girl?"

"Of whom do you speak? There is no other girl here but you?" he replied.

"Yes, Master, it is just you and I. But last night, you called out her name...when you came to save me?"

"I recall doing no such thing."

"'Amelia' was the name you spoke, Master."

Sir Richard responded only with silence.

"Master?" she inquired again after receiving no reply.

"What?"

"Amelia is not my name. Of whom were you speaking?"

"Never mind that, Girl. What IS your name?" he quickly replied, changing the subject.

She blushed with a small smile and responded, "Liliana is my true name, Master."

Chapter 3

Liliana

The road had been long, and Liliana's feet grew tired, but she resolved herself not to complain and further burden her protector as she struggled to keep up with his quick stride. In such a short amount of time, he had already saved her from peril and defile twice now, so she wished not to be a nuisance.

"Master?" she asked.

"Girl, er uh, I mean, Liliana, have I not told you to stop calling me that?" he replied.

"I am sorry, Master, but you still have given me no other name to call you. That, and the fact that you ARE my master."

"Very well, "he said with a sigh, "I am known as Sir Richard, one of the twelve of the order of the Knights of St. Thomas. Does that answer satisfy your inquisitive mind?"

"Yes!" she responded then paused before continuing, "Master Sir Richard of the Knights of St. Thomas, where are we going?"

"Girl, that is not how titles are meant to be said."

"But why? You referred to yourself that way, Master Sir Richard of th-"

"Enough," he interrupted with a wry chuckle that was uncharacteristic of the stoic man, "Alright, you win. Just call me, 'Master' if it pleases you so."

"As you wish, Master." she giggled. "So where are we headed?"

He paused for a moment before replying. "To my order's nearest commandery. It is not yet touched by the plague, and we should arrive before dusk."

"I see!...What are we going to do there?"

"Enough questions, Girl!" he snapped.

Liliana's face turned ashen, "I am sorry, Master."

Though it pained him, Sir Richard replied no further. He was still conflicted within as to where they were going and what they were doing. He knew that his mission should lead him to return to Durnwick Commandery, where he had first received the confession from the witch at the hands of Brother Paxton's torment. But he also knew that returning there would seal Liliana's fate. He was not sure why, but it sent a shiver down his spine to picture her tied down in the dungeon, where she would surely find torture and death. On the other hand, where else was there for him to go? His own commandery of Stahnburgh was much too far to reach this night. And he knew that he must report what had transpired at the Mills.

Finally, the two approached the outskirts of Danborough, the small town surrounding Durnwick. Sir Richard’s stomach was in knots, he knew that his window to change his mind was rapidly closing. As they entered the town, no one paid them any notice, as most people attempted to keep their distance from others, in the wake of the encroaching plague. Looking up the main street to the top of the hill, he could see the unceremonious stone building and tower that made up Durnwick Commandery. Making up his mind, Richard took Liliana by the hand, and pulled her down a side street, leading away from the commandery. He brought her to the only inn that was still operational in Danborough.

Upon entering the establishment, the pair were met with a dismal sight; a poorly lit tavern hall with naught but a couple of haggard patrons hunched over the fireplace in the corner. Sir Richard mused that the plague would soon put this inn out of business as well.

“’Ello, wot will it be?” the tavernkeeper greeted, “Food, or drink for you and your daughter?”

“The girl is not my daughter.” Sir Richard replied, abruptly. “We seek accommodations.”

The tavernkeeper noticed Richard’s heraldry upon his shield, “Ah, can’t keep this one over at yer fort, eh?”

“Keep your mind out of the mud, man! It is not as you suggest, and I will not have you question my honor like so again!” Richard replied indignantly.

“’Ave it yer way. None of my business.” The tavernkeeper replied as he sent them on their way to the room.

Despite his previous protest, Sir Richard noticed that the man had sent them to a room with but a single bed. However, he elected not to bring the matter up again, as it would be best not to elicit any more attention. He bade Liliana to wait there in the room, while he went to the fort to report his findings.

Deciding that it would be safer to leave Liliana at the inn for the night, Sir Richard slept in his quarters in the commandery after giving his report. In the wee hours of the morning, he finally returned to the inn. There, he found Liliana sleeping fitfully on the bed.

“Master?” she murmured as she began to wake. “I waited a long time for you. I feared that you would not return. It did not feel safe without you here.”

“Be at ease.” He replied. “You should be safe here for the moment. But now we must depart again.”

“Will I not get to see your fort, and meet the others of your order?”

“No! That will not be happening.”

“Oh…”

“We can discuss it more once we are away from here.” He said, reassuringly.

Liliana wrapped her arms around her tiny waist and looked up at Richard pleadingly, “Master, I do not wish to burden you anymore…but I feel weak. Please, Sir, do you have anything for me to eat?”

“Very well. Prepare yourself to leave, whilst I fetch you some victuals.” he replied. “I assume you can eat human fare?”

Shortly, he returned with two bowls of morning stew, and some coarse bread. The two hurriedly finished their food, and departed the inn. They went Eastward, away from the commandery, not wishing to be recognized. Sir Richard had explained to his fellows that he had business to conduct out of town, no one had questioned his intent, and he was free to depart unbothered.

As dawn crept into the morning sky, a thick cloud cover moved in and brought with it a cold and steady drizzle of rain. The rain silently rolled off of Sir Richard’s travel cloak, still wrapped about Liliana’s shoulders, a stark contrast to the clank and patter it made as it splashed against Richard’s unprotected steel armor. Liliana noticed this and began to unfasten the cloak’s clasp.

“Please, Master, the sun is hidden, have your cloak back. I will be fine.”

“Nay, Girl!” he said hastily, as he pulled the cloak about her once more. “You would be cold otherwise, with so little garb. Er, and I will not have anyone see me traveling with a daemon either!” He continued, in an attempt to feign callousness towards her.

“Yes, Master.” She said with another blush and a smile, clearly seeing straight through his ruse.

The two continued on for a short while before Liliana interrupted the silence once more and tugged on his armored sleeve, to ask another question.

“Master? Will you tell me now why I could not meet the others of your order?”

Sir Richard sighed, “There really is no hiding things from you, is there? I suppose you would need to have known sooner or later, after all. My order, the Knights of Saint Thomas are a group of holy men. Though the order may be in its twilight years, and has decayed to only twelve men holding the title, we are still resolute in our current duty, which is the cleansing of all daemonic witchcraft and the like from these lands. Do you understand?”

She shook her head.

“Call me a fool, but I sense no evil about you, Girl.” He replied reluctantly, “Though your existence would have warranted I smote you when first I saw you, I shall not. But I know the same understanding would not stay the hands of my fellow knights.”

“Thank you for protecting me, Master.” she said, bashfully. “I did not wish to put you at odds with your friends.”

“You need not thank me. I know right from wrong, and there would be no right in killing an innocent girl such as yourself.”

“Master? What is it that made you realize my innocence, if you think your fellows could not also see it?”

“Oh, that?” he replied, uncomfortably. “The look in your eyes, the picture of your face. I have…seen it before. Let us leave it at that.”

“I see.” She said, attempting to hide her smile.

Richard had not yet noticed in the dark, nor in the direct sunlight, because she kept her hood pulled low, but now he could see that Liliana also had a sharp set of small teeth in her mouth, somehow though, her smile was no less fetching than it had been before he had noticed. He pondered why it was that she smiled so, even at the smallest hint of caring interaction. Was she so deprived of such where she came from? Then this brought him back to the reality of the situation, where HAD she come from? He saw her summoned from the hellish pentagram with his own two eyes, but how could hell itself produce such a fair creature?

“So where, then are we going, Master?” Liliana finally asked, after another lull in the conversation.

“I am taking you some place where I can seek answers…where I hope you can be safe.” Richard replied.

A few more hours of travel brought them near their destination. The pair arrived on the outskirts of a completely ruined village known as Anburh, where, on the Eastern end rested the monastery of Wymond Abbey. The town looked as if a battle had come through; windows were smashed, doors torn from hinges, roofs collapsed, and debris scattered all about the streets. Cautiously, Sir Richard and Liliana wandered across town to the abbey, where they were met with a grisly sight. Surrounding the stone foundations and iron-wrought fences of the abbey were a collection of crude barricades and sharpened wood stakes, crafted of housing debris. Adorning the wood were the ragged corpses of a host of unknown creatures. None of the bodies could be discerned as anything particularly belonging to this world.

“Night beasts…” Sir Richard said in disgust, as he opened his visor to spit upon the ground.

Liliana squeaked in fear at the horrid sight.

“Fear not, Girl.” He reassured. “They are all dead.”

Richard rapped a heavy gauntlet against the wooden gate and waited. A painful silence passed, before a stirring could finally be heard from the other side. Finally, they heard a person slowly shuffle towards the door.

“Who goes there?” an elderly voice called out from the other side.

“Sir Richard, of the Knights of Saint Thomas!” he replied.

“Who’s the girl?” the old man asked.

“Naught but my ward for now! She seeks refuge with Sister Ruth!”

“Have either of you fallen ill?”

“No, we are both hale and hearty.” Richard said in response.

“Very well.” The old man replied as he slowly opened the old wooden gate. “Far be it from me to deny Sir Richard the Tall! Welcome, and God bless, brother.”

The courtyard on the other side of the fence was not what one would expect of an abbey. Crates and makeshift walkways lined the inner fence so that defenders could stand atop them and reach over the wall. In the soil were nearly twenty fresh graves, affixed with the standard crucifixes protruding upwards from the ground. As they approached the convent building of the abbey complex, they could hear a chorus coming from within. Upon entering, they saw a host of young children, all girls. They were singing a long series of Catholic hymns and prayers. Their combined voices were both angelic, and melancholic.

Once inside, Sir Richard removed his helm, and tucked it under his arm, out of respect for this holy place. Liliana did her best to contain any outward expressions of excitement, as this was the first time since they had met, which she had seen him without his helmet. She had been much too shy to ask him to remove it previously. He was a fair man with handsome features. Though he was a young man, his sharp blue eyes betrayed an old soul, burdened with many cares, and the lone scar stretching from his cheekbone down to the edge of his jaw suggested that he had seen many conflicts. His strong jawline was shaven, and his brown hair was tussled about from his helm.

The two went behind some cloisters, and into a backroom, away from the somber sounds of the children’s choir. There they waited for Sister Ruth, as she made her way out of an adjoining prayer room. Sister Ruth was a young woman, barely beyond her adolescent years. Her clothing was a simple black robe and white veil, standard of most nuns and holy women. Her stature was short, hardly even five feet, yet her figure was womanly. Despite the plainness of her cloth, her bosoms and hips were evident; her face was that of an angel; she truly was a beauty.

“Richard?!” she called out in a haughty tone, “I cannot believe you would come here now, after all this time!”

She strode over to him, and delivered a light smack on his cheek, upon delivery, her wrath instantly subsided, and she stood upon her tiptoes, holding his face in both her hands. After a wistful moment of staring into each other’s eyes, she released his face, and stood back upon her heels.

“What happened to your handsome face?! You’re hurt!” she scolded.

“Yes, the scar is new since last we were together. I was caught unaware by a large Frenchmen at the Battle of Crécy across the channel. The bastard stood nearly as tall as I.”

Sister Ruth instantly wore a look of concern.

“I have since begun keeping my helm on more frequently, so as to not be caught off-guard again.” He continued. “But enough of that, please do not worry.”

“And now you tell me not to worry? After you have been gone and thus returned?” she replied, placing a hand upon his forearm. “What of all the time already spent in endless worry?”

“I am sorry that things become so, between us, Ruth.” He said, consolingly.

“There is naught that can be done for it now. So what has brought you to me?”

“I have come seeking help with this girl.” Richard said, gesturing towards Lilliana. “May we speak somewhere in private?”

“Of course.” Ruth responded with a nod and led him towards the prayer room.

“Liliana, please wait out here by the door.” Richard said, as he left the room.

Liliana waited outside of the prayer room restlessly. She wasn’t quite sure why, but she felt jealous of the relationship that evidently existed between the Sister, and her Master; she also felt a slight pang of jealousy in the pit of her stomach when thinking of the time that the two were spending together in seclusion at that moment. It felt as if Sir Richard and Sister Ruth were away for an eternity, but, eventually, they finally opened the door, and bade her to enter and join their conversation. Richard stood in the corner with his arms crossed and allowed Ruth to initiate the discussion.

“Liliana, Sir Richard has told me all he knows of you thus far. How you came to meet, what he saw in those chambers.” Ruth said, as she traced the path of a crucifix across her bosom, as was customary when thinking or speaking of Satanic things.

“I see...” Liliana replied, casting a nervous glance towards her master.

“I must say, I am surprised that he has taken to protecting you. Sir Richard is a man of staunch faith, if he says you are not of the Devil, then I hold his words with merit! But we must be sure.”

“Very well, how can I help you be sure?” Liliana said nervously.

“While you waited, I’ve prepared some tests for you. Please step over here.”

Sister Ruth led Liliana over to a table, upon which were three items: a basin of water, a Holy Bible, and a crucifix with rosary beads. She gestured first towards the basin of water.

“This is holy water, blessed by our priest himself. Please place your hand within the basin.” Sister Ruth said.

Liliana looked at Richard, “But Master, I thought you trusted me?!”

“Girl, I do not know you,” he said, finally breaking his silence. “I have been given a conviction to feel apathy for you and to protect you, but your very existence questions what my order stands for. I must put you to the test before God and know for sure. Please do not resist. If you wish to back out, you may, but know that if you do, you must depart from this place, and from my company.”

“No! Please, I would not be apart from you, Master! You do not know me, because you have not asked! I am scared, but I will do as you say.”

After a brief pause, Liliana exhaled slowly, and stepped up to the basin, with an outstretched hand. Slowly, she slid her dainty hand into the cool, clear water of the basin. Nothing happened, the water remained calm, and Liliana was unharmed. Next, Sister Ruth bade her to grasp the crucifix. Again, there was no reaction. After that, she was instructed to open the Bible, and read several passages. She did not burst into flame, or anything else of the sort. Finally, Sister Ruth placed her hands upon the girl’s shoulders, and murmured a prayer.

“Lord, if this girl is indeed not a wicked child, then I pray that you take her into your blessing and watch over her. Please, deliver us from all that is evil, amen.”

Sister Ruth then wrapped both arms around Liliana and gave her a quick hug.

“Liliana, I am sorry that we could not take you at your word, and that we had to put you to the test. Please forgive us, sweet girl.” Ruth said.

Liliana melted into the hug and looked as if she could burst into tears. “I-it is okay. Thank you, Sister.”

Sir Richard uncrossed his arms and walked across the room to join his companions. He knelt down next to Liliana and placed a heavy hand upon her shoulder with a somber smile.

“I am relieved that you passed Sister Ruth’s tests. And I am also sorry that you had to. But you are right, I do not know you, for I have not asked. So please, Liliana, will you tell us? Who are you?...What are you? How have you come to be here?” Sir Richard asked.

“It is okay, Master. There is nothing to forgive.” She said, sweetly. “I suppose I should start with where I came from. I am not of this world, I was summoned here, through a ritual.”

“Indeed. I beheld the ritual with my own eyes. The Satanists had etched a pentagram upon the ground, and you rose up from it. Was this a portal to hell itself?” he asked, inquisitively.

“No, Master. I do not come from what you would call hell. Though many demons do praise the lake of fire and Sulphur as somewhat of a promised afterlife, it is not so.”

“You are correct.” Ruth interjected. “Hell, itself is intended to be a prison for Satan. It would be a place of torment and torture for demon and man alike, so says the scripture.”

“Yes, I know little of such things, but I know that hell is a bad place.” Liliana responded. “I come from a place that my people refer to as, the Nether. It is another dimension entirely, and home to all demon-kind.”

“What then is this Nether like?” Richard asked.

“I believe it is similar to what humans think of as hell. It is a depraved place of darkness and pestilence. Only the Nether is no prison, sinners are not cast into the flame, but rather demons are able to rule and have freedom to enact all of their cruelty with no protest.” Explain Liliana.

“I see. And what of you, Liliana? Would you remove your cloak for me to see?” Asked Ruth.

Liliana looked to her master for guidance. Richard nodded, “Do as the Sister asks.”

Reluctantly, she unclasped Sir Richard’s large cloak, which had been enveloping her entire body, and allowed it to slide onto the floor. Liliana cast her gaze upon her feet and stood there awkwardly, feeling the eyes of her companions upon her. Sister Ruth gasped quietly upon seeing her demonic extremities, and scanty clothing.

&&

“I am sorry, Sister.” Liliana said with a quiver in her voice. “I know I must be hideous to your eyes.”

“O-oh, no, no!” Ruth said, quickly shaking her head. “You certainly are not. I just…am not accustomed to such sinful garb. We must find some appropriate clothing for you! Richard, how could you let this poor girl wander about in naught but her skin!?”

“We had no girls’ dresses on hand at the commandery. I came to you as quickly as I could, without drawing suspicion.” He replied.

“Yes, I suppose that will excuse your sin.” Ruth replied as she then turned her attention back to Liliana. “But what then of your body? You have the frame of a human girl, but features of demon folk?”

“I am not wholly human, nor demon. I am a half breed of sorts.” She replied, with a look of shame upon her face.

“I suppose that does make sense. Angels once descended upon our world and bred with women. The children were known as the Nephilim. What then of you? What are you called?” Ruth asked.

“Amongst your people, my race would be called the Succubi. Long ago, when this world was still young, a cruel demon named Astaroth came up from the Nether, and abducted a girl named Lilith. He forced her to be his concubine and had children with her. Her sons grew to be grand demons amongst the armies of Astaroth, and her daughters became the slaves that you know as Succubi. Ever since our people’s birth, the Succubi have been the demon’s playthings, subjected to their malice and cruelty.

Lilith may be revered as the Succubus Queen; she is still little more than a slave to Astaroth. Her children are forced into servitude. Some willingly serve demons as their masters in the Nether, others are sent or summoned here to your world to corrupt human men.”

“I see. So, you WERE sent here to bring about my downfall?” Richard responded coldly.

“No, Master! I was um…not sent for that reason.” She replied nervously. “I was..too young, but sometimes, in their cruelty, the demons force us into servitude even at an early age. But that is not why I was sent here!”

“Sent, or summoned?” Richard asked, mistrustingly.

“Er, well…both, I suppose?” she replied, whilst fidgeting.

“Enough, Richard!” Can you not see that you are making the poor girl uncomfortable?” Ruth said scoldingly. “These vile things are hard to talk about. I believe she has told us plenty. Let us leave it be.”

“Very well, I am sorry.” He said, reproachfully. “I am sometimes lacking in decorum.”

“It is alright, Master.” Liliana replied with a sigh of relief.

After their discussion, Liliana was allowed to cover herself once more, while Sister Ruth went to fetch her some conservative clothing, and some food. Ruth garbed the girl in the same simple dress that the orphan girls were wearing, then they supped on meager fare while discussing their next move.

“So, you have your answers. What now is your plan?” Ruth asked.

“I had hoped the girl could stay here with you.” Richard responded.

“I am not sure if that can be done. We are beyond capacity with orphans from the plague.”

“I can see.” He replied. “And what is going on at your gates? I have noticed a growing anxiety in you as the day wears on?”

“The situation here is dire. Every day, once the sun goes down, we are beset by a host of night beasts. Vile creatures of the underworld that know only demons as their masters. I am sure you saw the graves as you entered?”

“We did.” Richard replied stoically.

“Indeed.” Ruth continued. “It happened first, naught even a fortnight ago, when the other sisters were about the fields. Most were slain quickly, leaving now only myself, and Mother Gretel, the elder. That is how I passed through my novicehood and became head sister so quickly.

Since then, the monks and friars of the Abbey, set up a perimeter defense, and have fought to fend off their nightly attacks. But it has been a war of attrition. At least five fell to the plague, the rest of the graves out there belong to those who fell defending our grounds from the nightly raids. Through word of mouth, we learned that some cultists were nearby, conducting their summoning rituals just outside of town. The bulk of our remaining men, some ten strong armed themselves as best they could, and went out to end these cultists. They never returned. Now all who remain to defend us are the five eldest monks. They have been fighting bravely, but I fear we will not last the week.”

“Ruth…” Richard began, with an uncharacteristic hint of worry in his voice. “Why had you not sent for me, or a contingent from my order?! What if I had not happened to come now as I have? What then would you have done?”

“We have exhausted our options.” She replied. “We’ve no steeds, nor could we spare anyone to send as a runner, and all of our pigeons have fallen ill to a pestilence as well. The children would never survive the journey. The night beasts would catch us before we made it to the next settlement.”

“Fear not, dear Ruth.” Richard said in a robust voice. “I will deliver you from this evil! Dusk will soon be upon us. Tonight, I will help to fend off the night beasts, and when first they retreat at Dawn’s light, I will seek out the summoners and end them. So help me, God!”

Chapter 4

The Raid

The following evening, all were prepared for the night beasts’ return, Sister Ruth, Liliana and the children were all locked away safely within the secure stone walls of the abbey. There had been more than a few protests from Liliana about being separated from her master in preparation for the imminent attack, but she had finally conceded, and took to her newfound duties with Sister Ruth.

Sir Richard, and the five remaining elder monks stood at the ready in the courtyard, within the perimeter fence, with the former armed and armored to the teeth, and the latter wearing only simple robes or habits, and armed meagerly with clubs, cudgels or pitchforks. They had torches and braziers lit and placed at key points along the wall. The sun was nearly set, and the defenders knew that the enemy host would be upon them shortly.

No more than half an hour after the sun had set, the night beasts came. Like moths swarming to a flame, they came in droves, hideous four-legged creatures they were. Most of them had bodies like that of a hairless dog covered in boney protrusions. The creatures’ heads were unlike any known animal entirely, gaping exaggerated jaws with jagged teeth and multiple eyes upon some. The beasts charged the ramshackle fortifications head-on, eagerly throwing their bodies at the wall, clawing the wood and skewering themselves upon the wooden stakes.

The next wave of beasts clawed the flesh of their impaled brethren and used them to further climb the fortifications and reach the top. At the precipice, the defenders were ready and used their long weapons to repel the bests as they clambered over the top. Many of the monks’ blunt weapons and age-stiffened swings were insufficient at delivering fatal blows, but for every night beast they failed to slay in a single blow, Sir Richard made up for by killing two more. From the shadows, just beyond the reach of the torch light, the night beasts’ demon masters could be heard cackling and cheering.

As the fighting ensued in the courtyard, the women inside the Abbey huddled together in fear. Liliana, who’s soul was caring, and voice was sweet had taken herself into a big sister role of sorts and had helped to console and calm the orphan children before the fighting began; she was now cowering in fear along with the rest of them. Her heart was filled with concern for the well being of her master outside. She feared that he would be hurt, as she did care for him, and she also feared what it would mean for herself if he were to be wounded or slain. Losing the assistance of her newfound helper, the duty of calming the children now fell solely on Sister Ruth.

“Come girls, let us hold hands and pray for God’s protection upon our defenders!” She said in a collected voice.

“Yes, Sister.” They squeaked in terror.

Sir Richard and the monks fought off the first attack. Throughout the night, every hour or two, the demons and night beasts would return, and assault different parts of the abbey’s defensive perimeter. Every time, the demon masters would bark unintelligible orders to their beast minions, using a guttural black speech dialect. Though, with each assault, the demons remained in the shadows just out of sight, careful not to reveal themselves. As the night’s darkness gave sway to dawn’s first light, creeping over the hilltops, the attacks subsided. Luckily, the defenders survived with no death, however, all five of the old monks had been injured this time. They thanked Richard for his service, stating that they likely would not have survived the night without his help. He nodded in acknowledgement of their thanks, and hurried inside the abbey.

The smell of damp stone and bodily fluids hung in the air, evident of the fact that some of the orphan girls were unable to control their fear during the raid. &&&&

Upon seeing him enter, Liliana sprang to her feet and leapt at Sir Richard, clinging to his chest. So great was her relief, that she could muster no words, but merely cried silent tears of joy. Sister Ruth, although longing to also embrace her knight, held herself in reserve, not wishing to make a spectacle in front of the children, nor finding it appropriate to interrupt Liliana and her master. Despite the bittersweetness of the situation, Ruth could not help but to find amusement at the confused look upon Richard’s face as he removed his helm; he clearly did not know what to do about the young girl holding on to him.

“Liliana, I must be swift, their masters are escaping.” He said as he lightly held her shoulders and gently set her back upon the floor. “I came merely to ensure that you were all unharmed, but I must be off.”

“Y-yes, Master.” She stammered, finally able to speak. “Let us go!”

“Us? No, Girl, you must continue to stay here, where it is safe.” Richard responded.

“What? No!” she cried hotly, wiping away her remaining tears. “Being apart for the battle was one matter, but leaving me here entirely without you? We cannot be separated so, Master!”

“I am departing to bring the fight to their masters, and here you are, cowering like a babe, this will be no journey for you. The dawn’s light will shortly be past the trees, and the demons will have escaped. I must leave now, and you will stay here with Sister Ruth. I will hear NO more of it!”

Richard retrieved his dark travel cloak from Liliana, and hurried back outside, leaving her there in distress. Wrapping himself in the cloak, Richard masked his white surcoat and armor. He went in the direction which he had last heard the vile speech of the demons during the battle, and kept himself to the shadows, so as not to be seen from afar. He moved as quickly as he could while keeping his body stiff and using controlled movements, attempting to reduce the clang of his armor as much as possible.

Before long, the sun had crept past the treetops, and was shining in the open. This slowed the demons’ movements and allowed Sir Richard to catch up. They saw that he was at their heels, however they did not wish to fight in the open sunlight and continued their flight away from the ruined village. This pack of demons, some four strong, were not like the large demons he had faced in the dungeons of Bleakwind Mills, or at the abandoned homestead, they had narrow frames, and hunched backs, complimented by unusually long, lanky limbs, which betrayed their silhouettes as not quite human.

Despite being heavily armored, Sir Richard was a man of great vigor, and could carry along with a strong trot for many miles whilst armored. The sunlight was a boon for him, he soon closed the distance on the demons, as the sun’s rays had slowed them. They attempted to fight back using their sharp claws, but their movements were languid, as if in a stupor. He quickly slew all but the last demon, allowing it to continue its escape so that he could follow it the rest of the way to what he hoped would be the lair of the summoners.

Away from the village, along the countryside lay a moderately sized farmhouse, seemingly abandoned. The demon fled to the house and went directly to the cellar. Richard’s gamble had paid off. Shortly after the demon entered, Richard followed, crashing through the cellar doors. Seeing that there was only one apparent entrance, he opted for a frontal assault, rather than attempting to sneak in, which would almost assuredly have resulted in him losing the element of surprise. Charging in head-first allowed him to take on whoever or whatever was inside before they had a chance to gather their wits.

Inside the cellar, he came face to face with the aforementioned demon, and two elderly men garbed in cultist robes. Upon the floor was a large pentagram, which Richard had now come to associate with the cults satanic summoning practices. Now that the demon was in the cooling dark of the cellar, it sprung into action with a renewed vigor, slashing at the Knight’s shield with its long, gnarled claws. However, this demon was not bred for fighting, and was not a challenging opponent for this seasoned demon hunter. In one swift movement, Richard allowed the creature to move in close to his shield, where he then sliced off both of its hands with his sword. The hellish creature stood there in shock for but a moment, before Richard swung again, lobbing off its head. In that same moment, the two elderly cultists were also now upon him, brandishing short swords, but they were no fighters either, lacking armor and youth, they were quickly dispatched.

After ensuring there were no remaining foes lurking about, Sir Richard tarnished the summoning pentagram until it was illegible, then he put the house to the torch. Now, he still had many hours of daylight remaining, and chose to continue his search. Marching along in the noontime sun, he searched far and wide about the surrounding countryside, but turned up no other signs of cult activity. As dusk approached, he made his way back to the abbey.

At last, through his slow trudge, Sir Richard arrived at the monastery gates and wearily went inside. He was utterly exhausted, having fought all through the night and morn, then traversing the hills for the remainder of the day. Sister Ruth came out to the courtyard to greet him with a smile, as he removed his helm to return her greeting.

“At last, you return to us!” she said, warmly. “Liliana has been worried sick for her master, and has caught not even a minute of sleep.”

“Tell her I am sorry for the worry.” He responded, his voice stretched and tired.

“You can tell her yourself, she awaits inside, sheltering from the last remaining rays of sunlight.”

“Very well, I will do so. But what of you, dear Ruth? Did you not worry at all?” he asked, mustering a wry smile, despite his fatigue.

“Yes, of course I did! I have worried for you every day since first you left for war, but…” she trailed off.

“Please, I speak only in jest, do not trouble yourself with such thoughts, Ruth. Let us go and greet the girl.”

The two entered the abbey proper, where they were met with a distraught, yet also angry Liliana. She stood there amidst the pews, hands upon her hips, staring at Sir Richard.

“Master! How could you keep us in suspense like this! You did not say you would be gone all day!” she exclaimed in a haughty tone.

“Forgive me, but I could not return until I was sure I had bested all of our enemies.”

Liliana quickly lost the hot-headed persona, as her lip began to quiver, “I was just worried. I thought you were slain, or perhaps had abandoned me here, your last words to me showed that I have become an annoyance to you. I should be the one saying sorry.”

“Uh, no, no, do not worry, Girl.” He replied, caught off-guard by her sudden change in demeanor. “You are not an annoyance to me, be at ease.”

Not knowing what else to do, Richard placed his hand atop her head and continued soothingly, “Come, Liliana, Sister Ruth and I have much to discuss, if you are so set on not being apart, then you may join us.”

The three of them again adjourned to the back prayer room, where they could plan in private. Sister Ruth daintily sat herself at one end of a small table in the room and Sir Richard wearily lowered himself into a chair at the other end with a clank from his armor that now weighed heavily upon his shoulders. Liliana stood at Richard’s side, her tiny hands clutching the bend of his arm, refusing to let go.

“I tracked the demons from last night that were commanding the night beasts,” Richard began, “They lead me to their human summoners and put a stop to it. High and lo I searched after that, but could find no other signs of additional summoners, or demonic nests. I believe we are safe for the time being.”

“We owe you our lives.” Ruth said, reaching across the table and briefly grasping his gloved hand.

“I think it best if all of you leave this place though. If more return, you will not be able to defend against another attack, and I cannot stay here permanently to protect you.”

“I believe you are right. We should have left long ago, when we still had the chance….before so many perished needlessly to safekeep this place.” She said, with a hint of sorrow in her voice.

“It is in the past now. Things like this are beginning to happen everywhere. It is not your fault. Still though, this is the worst I have encountered yet. You should travel West, from whence I came, the pestilence is not so rampant there.”

“So I have heard.” Ruth replied, “The tales that reached me from the East were ghastly. Most I could scarcely believe, but travelers have since stopped coming from the East.”

“We should still wait until morning before departing. I want to take another night here in our defendable position just to be sure, else another host that I could not find descends upon us in the open night while we travel. I would not be able to protect all of you at once. Nor would I have the strength, I have not slept for nigh two days, and have fought much.”

“That would be a wise course to take. We will follow your judgement.” She replied.

“Very good then. We will still need to post a watch at night though. Are any of the monks still able to do so?”

“They are still abed with their injuries. It will be trouble enough for them to travel in the morn.”

“Very well, it will fall to me then. Can you arrange some food to be brought out to me when I am on the wall?”

“Richard, no. You must rest!” Ruth exclaimed. “As the next clergy woman in line, this duty should fall to me.”

“No, I cannot allow that. When last I left you, you knew naught of fighting in the least. Has your time in the cloth changed that?” Richard retorted.

“Well, no…” she responded, “But you will not be any more rested by morning either. If something happens, I could come and fetch you.”

“That will not work either. It would take too long for you to come find me.”

“You must rest somehow?”

“Fine, we will both sit atop the wall.” He responded, “I will sleep upon the wall with you at my side. The moment you see anything, you can waken me, and I will be at the ready.”

“I see that I cannot sway you.” Ruth said begrudgingly, “So that will be our course of action.”

“Let us be off then, night is already upon us.” Richard said.

“Wait!” Liliana piped up, “Please let me join you! I can help keep watch so that you can rest, Master.”

Not possessing the energy to argue with her pleading eyes, Richard relented. “As you wish. But you will go inside and barricade yourself there the moment we say so, if the need arises. Understood?”

“Yes, Master.” Liliana replied with a beaming smile.

Sir Richard and Liliana headed for the gate first, while Sister Ruth put the orphans to bed. The two seated themselves on the makeshift parapets nearest to the front gates. Richard was just tall enough that, even while sitting flat, he could turn his head and see over the edge. Liliana had to balance herself upon her knees just to reach high enough to be able to peer over.

“It is cold, Master.” She said with a shiver.

“You wished to be out here with me.” Richard scolded.

“I know. It is fine, I do not wish to be apart from you.”

“Here.” He said with a sigh as he removed his travel cloak and wrapped it around her once more, “Take this to keep warm.”

“Thank you Master. Will you be able to sleep without it?”

“Fear not, my gambeson is thick, and my armor heavy, it shall warm me.” He replied. “Do not feel guilt over using my cloak. Chivalry dictates that I would lend it to a lady.”

“You take care of me well, Master.” She said, hugging herself with mirth.

“It’s not that, so much as it is…” Richard said turning red, “Well fine, I suppose I do.”

“Master?” Liliana said, after a long pause.

“What is it?”

“I am sorry that I angered you last night.”

“Liliana, it is as I told you before, you did nothing wrong. If anything, I must apologize to you. I fear that I spoke harshly to you. I meant not to bring shame to you either. You are young and should not feel shame for your fear. I have been a Soldier for some time now, and when the situation is dire, orders require a concise lack of decorum, and it seems I was that way with you. Still though, my point stands; despite the land that you come from, you have a sweet and innocent soul, you really are no fighter, are you?”

“Please, you are my Master, you may speak to me as you wish! No forgiveness is needed.” She replied, clutching his arm once more, “But you are right, I hate violence, and would not know what to do with myself in a fight. I just wish to be useful to you though…”

“You are useful to me though…” Richard replied, pausing as he tried to think of a use to calm the girl’s mind, “See, um, you are helping me right now, are you not? You will assist Sister Ruth with the lookout, so that I may rest my weary bones.”

Liliana smiled at this, and hugged Richard’s arm to her flat bosom, “I suppose the servant can care for the Master as well, sometimes.”

“I will tell you again,” Richard began, “You do not need to call me your master. I only wish to protect you; I look for nothing in return.”

“But you are my master!” she replied with an angelic giggle.

“There is no wining with you…” he replied with a deep sigh.

At that moment, Sister Ruth exited the abbey and joined them in the courtyard. She now wore a thick shawl over her usual holy garb and came bearing a tray of food. She seated herself next to Richard, opposite of Liliana, and passed out the meal. It was a simple fare, consisting of thin stew, and coarse bread; however, none were complaining, as all three were hungered, especially Sir Richard, who had been battling and wandering nonstop for the prior two days.

After they had supped, Liliana wasted no time in falling fast asleep. She had not noticed her fatigue amidst her worry for her master while he was on his hunt, but now, upon first relaxing, sleep instantly overtook her. She lay there, curled up next to her master, absorbing his body heat. Richard shifted uncomfortably, as he now had nowhere to lay, but he did not have the heart to move her as she slept so peacefully. Ruth sat upon her knees, with her legs folded underneath her, and patted her lap.&&

“Come, rest your head here across my lap.” She said, beckoning to Richard.

“I cannot do that.” He replied, “You are a woman of the cloth now, would they not look upon you ill for that?”

“For what? I am merely tending to our protector. Sleep will not find you if you stay in your current position.” She said sweetly.

“You know that I cannot remove my armor right now. Will that not discomfort you?”

“I will be fine so long as you do not wear your helmet again.” She said, patting her lap once more, “Come, it will be just as it was when we were younger.”

Reluctantly, Richard finally gave in, and rotated his body to the side, allowing him to lay down, and place his head in Ruth’s lap. Her thighs were soft and supple, and to Richard, in his current state, they felt as if to be heavenly feather pillows, gifted from above. Ruth brushed his wavy hair out of his face, and lightly stroked his scalp, as his consciousness began to fade.

“Sleep now, my Richard and worry naught.” She breathed softly in his ear.
