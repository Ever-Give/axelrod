Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. I'll move it to the appropriate place if that's the case.

There was a story that was posted on FurAffinty a while back, entitled "Back Alley Business". It was about two guys, Tyler and Wesley(?), who are on a date, and then Tyler has to pee, so Wesley(?) tries to encourage him to pee in public spaces, until they eventually pee in an alley together, with Tyler admitting afterwards that he actually liked peeing in the alley.

I remember reading the story a while ago, but it appears to have been deleted, and I don't remember who the writer was, so I have been unable to locate it. It's a bit of a longshot, but if anyone here remembers the story and/or the user who wrote it, that would be most appreciated!
