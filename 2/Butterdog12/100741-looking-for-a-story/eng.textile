Hey looking for a story I read a few years ago and I haven’t been able to find it since. I think originally I read it on wattpad but anyways

It was about a woman who gets a job at a daycare but has an accident or two and they end up putting her diapers as well and it kinda spirals downward from there. I’ve seen a lot of similar stories on there so I apologize in advance if it’s not specific enough but I’ve just been looking for this one for a while now and would really appreciate the help. Thanks!
