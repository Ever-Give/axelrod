Author's Note:

So, this is the first story I've ever posted online. I usually struggle pretty hard with writer's block but somehow, I managed to pop out most of chapter one in the course of an afternoon. Just trying to get more experience and consistency with writing regularly ... and getting comfortable actually sharing my works instead of just keeping them locked away on a hard drive!😂

Anyway! I intended for this just to be a two-parter one-shot. Chapter one is more set-up but has some Omo parts while Chapter two is longer and far more omo focused. Could definitely expand further upon the story though if I get the drive to. Chapter two coming... sometime soon within the next day or two.

Chapter One

Elira Fawn

Race: Human

Class: Sorceress (Heroine)

Level: 3

Health: 80/80

Mana: 140/140

Strength: 7

Dexterity: 12

Constitution: 10

Intelligence: 10

Wisdom: 8

Charisma: 14

Luck: 2

Bladder Strength: 10

Bladder Capacity: 75/100

Yup. That’s me…

Elira let out a soft groan, impatiently bouncing her foot against the floor of the wagon. Even though that she could see right there that she had a good way to go before she hit her limit, it certainly didn’t make the pressure in her bladder feel any better.

“Can we go any faster? These goblins are not going to kill themselves.” The sorceress’s long black hair whipped about her as she glared at the driver. Gary, she thinks his name was.

“Can’t be making too much noise now. We’ll attract attention. We’re about ten minutes away from the rendezvous spot though.” The driver responded tensely, his attention too focused on looking out for any ambushes to notice the pale woman’s desperate state.

“Ten minutes…” She replied through gritted teeth. Her eyes screwed shut as an aching pang shot through her abdomen. She let out a sigh, squeezing and rubbing her thighs together. She could make it. She knew she could make it. In the week that she has been in this world, she’s come to estimate that it takes about four hours for her to go from empty to bursting if she was regularly keeping hydrated throughout.

She still had an hour left.

She could make it. With time to spare. The tight black corset hugging at her bulging abdomen and the constant bouncing of the cart didn’t make it feel that way though.

How the hell did I end up in this situation…

Elira bitterly cursed at her predicament. A mere week ago she was an ordinary college student in the midst of studying for her exams. One night, she had made to flop onto her bed… and ended up waking up onto a forest floor.

It was the type of stuff that a person reads about in fantasy novels all the time. Ordinary person gets transported to another world and gifted with all sorts of mystical abilities.

Only I didn’t get a goddess or whatever giving me the rundown of how stuff here works or explaining to me how the hell do I get back home…

Bladder Capacity: 77/100

The sorceress sucked in a sharp breath, pushing her hand between her legs to squeeze and hold at her pussy as another jolt distracted her thoughts. She wore all black, including panties - looking like some sort of goth witch. Not exactly what she had been wearing to bed at the time, but she wasn’t going to complain. Better than walking around in PJs. And honestly? She liked the style.

She uncrossed and recrossed her legs restlessly as her bladder strained against her tight clothing. Discomfort shooting through her as she felt her pee shift and slosh around inside of her.

The long and short of was that she needed coin to survive. And killing monsters plaguing the locals seemed to be the best way to do it. She wished she had emptied her bladder after breakfast and before setting out though.

Bladder Capacity: 80/100

Elira was not a math major in her previous life, but she knew enough to know that more than ten minutes had to have passed for a five percent increase. Though just as she was about to voice her complaints to the driver, the wagon began to crawl to a halt.

“Here we are.”

“Finally…” Elira carefully hopped on down, wincing softly as her knee-high boots landed upon the ground but quickly straightening up afterwards. She didn’t have a desire to let a random guy know how close she was to pissing herself right now.

“Well… I’m off.” She gave a brisk wave of her hand as she turned away. The sorceress and her aching bladder eager to find some bush to duck behind to empty herself before she got to work.

“Good luck, Miss. We’ll be waiting for you at the village.” The driver nodded, hopping back on his horse before riding off.

“Would have been nice to have a ride back though…” She grumbled as moved through the forest. Not that she could blame him for not wanting to stick around. Best that she had seen is that most ordinary humans around here capped out at around level two and rarely had more than eight in any given stat. She had yet to find another of a defined ‘class’ like herself. Her class, combined with her ‘Heroine’ status gave her an increase to most of her stats all around… Except for her luck, which remained at a concerningly low number.

“Oooh-!”

Elira gasped suddenly and doubled over, squeezing her thighs together. Her body shaking and vibrating as her urethra strained to hold back all that hot urine stored in her abdomen. She lost her train of thought as she squirmed and wiggled in place.

Bladder Capacity: 82/100

“I know… I know…” She hissed, squatting down and pulling her panties aside. A harsh groan unintentionally slipping out from her as a golden jet of fluid began to gush out from her loins.

Bladder Capacity: 70/100

Bladder Capacity: 60/100

“Why the hell is this even a thing!?” She shouted in exasperation - a sentence she thought frequently with every piss. Out of all the various biological needs - why was her bladder the one that had stats attached to it. It brought some comfort that it appears that she is the only one in this world able to view stats… and that she didn’t see the same explicit information when viewing the stats of others - only the basic attributes and level.

Bladder Capacity: 0/100

Elira breathed out a sigh of relief as she stood up and set her panties right. A few lingering drops of piss stained into the fabric - only to vanish as the sorceress casted a spell to cleanse her attire.

“Beats having to do the laundry…” She muttered as she began to trudge deeper into the forest. Aside from the clothes on her back, she woke up with an enchanted bag. Bottomless, able to store near anything she would need and retrieve with just a thought of the item.

Elira fished around for a water-skin, taking a deep chug from it before placing it back. She had three of them stored away, each holding about two liters of water. This one she had already drank halfway over the course of the trip. Even before, she always got thirsty easily and drank a lot.

… I suppose that knowing exactly how full my bladder is at any given time IS convenient if nothing else. She begrudgingly admitted. The thought offered some small comfort at least as she took generous sips out of her water-skin. Not as if she can’t just piss anywhere in the forest when she needs to.

Bladder Capacity: 50/100

Elira rubbed at her abdomen as she stared at her stats. Two hours more or less until she would reach her limit. She could feel the weight in her bladder start to grow, but she wasn’t in any particular rush to pee before she got to work. There was more than enough time to finish the job and even search the place for any loot before she needed to go.

The goblins had set up in some sort of abandoned shack out in the woods. From what she saw, a goblin was about level two - though with her stats, taking out a group of them wouldn’t be an issue.

She took a long sip from her water-skin as she looked around. Despite it being pitch-black, her enhanced eyes could see as easily as if it were day, though with a lack of color. ‘Darkvision’, her page had called it. Her spells followed a similar theme to her outfit - dark and moody.

Real ‘heroic’ powers they decided to give me. She remarked sarcastically in her mind as she stood up - polishing off one last sip before stowing away her water. She hadn’t fought with her powers much - though she had managed to come up with a plan of action.

She moved on up towards the entrance of the shack, keeping close to the shadows. Most of the goblins were gathered in the center around a bonfire. Some on guard, the others a sleep. None were spared. Shadows gathered in Elira’s hand, coalescing before firing out towards them; the shadowy matter then exploding between all of them. The sorceress disappearing from sight, stepping out from a shadowed wall flanking them as she began firing smaller bolts at the survivors.

Mana: 40/100

Bladder Capacity: 55/100

Elira dusted off her hands as she paced around inside of the building, poking through the goblin’s corpses for anything of value - cutting ears as she did for proof of the job done. All in all, she managed to nab herself an additional twenty gold coins.

“Not bad for a day’s work. And I still have the reward waiting for me…” She drained another sip from her water-skin, wishing that she had one filled with wine for celebration. She paused mid-sip as she noticed a glimmer of metal out of the corner of her eyes.

A chest.

Treasure! Two luck? As if!

Elira grinned as she approached the chest. There were scratches on the lock - the goblins seeming to have tried and failed to break it. Where they failed with physical force, she succeeded with magic - firing out a bolt at the lock to shatter it.

Inside was a simple ring and nothing else. Elira almost would have been disappointed if not for the magical energy she could feel radiating off of it. With no hesitation, she slid it over a finger.

Immediately, Elira felt a strange sensation wash over her. She stood there for a moment, confused, before it would hit her. The pressure that had been nursing in her bladder was suddenly… gone! Her hand shot down to her crotch, her first thought being to check if she somehow wet herself before she would relax when it was clear that wasn’t the case.

She blinked, pulling up her stats in her mental view.

Bladder Capacity: 60/250

You can’t be serious…

Elira furrowed her brow. Not quite the treasure she had been hoping for. She peered down at her finger, finding that she could examine the ring now that she was wearing it.

Ring of Capacity: Increases the bearer’s bladder strength by 5 points per level.

*Curse of Shyness

…Curse of what?

Curse of Shyness: This item cannot be removed. For as long as the cursed item is worn, the bearer will be unable to urinate anywhere other than a private space. The bearer can not urinate outdoors even if alone. The bearer can not urinate in spaces recently inhabited by hostile creatures even if fully cleared. The secured, private space most be enclosed by walls and either a door or privacy curtain. This curse does not stop forced urination once bladder capacity is exceeded.

Elira stared with empty eyes at the wall of text she just read. She squinted, reading over it carefully once more.

… No fucking way. This has to be a joke.

A nervous sweat beaded upon the sorceress’s skin as she marched outside and yanked down her panties - exposing her bare loins to the cool night air. She squatted down and closed her eyes, all the muscles in her abdomen clenching as she willed herself to pee. She never had an issue with shyness before and used to be able to use public restrooms as easily as she pissed at home. But now… not even a drop pushed out from her - despite the weight of the hot fluid being noticeably present.

“No… No-no-no-no-NO! Fuck- FUCK! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!” She shouted as she shot back up and pulled up her undergarments. Panic rose in the sorceress’s chest as she ran her fingers through her hair and collected her thoughts. She took a moment to run the numbers through her head.

With how much her capacity grew, she estimated she could go about ten hours now without peeing. Maybe twelve if she cut back on the water. With how much she was carrying already, that left her with at best ten hours and most likely less than eight hours to return to town - by foot. A trek that would likely take most of a day.

It was tight, but she could, potentially, make it…

Make it just in time for the entire town to witness their big monster-slayer wetting herself like a child…

Elira shook her head ruefully, pushing the thought out of her head. Instead, she set off in a brisk pace - starting her long journey back to the village with nothing but darkness and a steadily swelling bladder as her companion.

*004*2025-08-08 18:27

This one ended up being a lot longer than I had originally intended for it to be. 😂 But anyway, here's chapter two! And thank you for the kind comments 🙂

Chapter Two

Bladder Capacity: 85/250

Elira hurriedly rushed through the darkened woods, coming to a halt as she found the spot that Gary had dropped her off. The dirt path that they had traveled on was not too much farther.

Fat chance of running into any other carriages - especially at this hour. The Sorceress grumbled. This route is constantly being ambushed by monsters. The camp that I cleared out must only be one of many.

She held at her abdomen, sighing as she felt at the liquid weight that she carried. A faint ‘silver-lining’ to the cursed ring if nothing else. Normally this amount of fluids would have her shimmy-dancing on the tips of her toes, but Elira felt like she could still go hours without peeing now.

“I’m fine… I’m fine…” Elira cleared her throat, which had become uncomfortably dry by now. She had refrained from drinking for the past hour in an effort to keep herself from filling up too fast, but her thirst was starting to win out over her better judgement.

Cursing her weakness, she dug into her pouch, pulling out another water skin and drank out from it, doing her best to not think about how all that water would soon be flowing towards her bladder.

She continued to drink as she walked, occasionally trading the water skin for some packed snacks. It was still the middle of the night. How she would have killed for an energy drink or a cup of coffee right about now. She estimated to have been awake for well over fourteen hours now.

Bladder Capacity: 105/250

She was reaching the four-hour point since she last relieved herself. Her features occasionally twisted into a wince whenever she made an odd step that jostled her bladder the wrong way.

“D-Damn it… Why is this happening…”

Elira whined, her voice coming out in heavy pants as she paused to lean against a tree. She was never exactly an athletic individual. Something that noticeably didn’t change even with her newfound ‘Heroine Stats’. Her legs ached almost as much as her bladder did from two hours of constant speed-walking. Sweat forming on her skin as she indulged in another deep sip of water.

Her bladder pushed past what normally would have been her limit. Even if she had plenty of capacity to spare, it was an uncomfortable feeling to be carrying so much liquid inside of her. She felt as she was going to burst at any moment! Elira groaned, leaning forward and shoving her hand deep into her crotch as her bladder pulsated desperately within.

“Stats say… I’m fine… I'm... fine…”

She chanted to herself, as if saying it repeatedly would make it any truer. Her focus shifting entirely towards just moving one foot after the next as she continued on down the path.

Bladder Capacity: 130/250

Elira panted heavily as she leaned against a tree, bouncing and swaying on one leg. The path behind her was littered with the corpses of goblins and wolves. She had been so distracted with keeping her bladder under control that she had walked into an ambush completely unaware. She had managed to handle them easily enough - though her bladder silently screamed at her with every cast of a spell.

“O-Ooohhh… C-Come on… I’m barely even… half-full…”

Elira’s eyes fluttered as the adrenaline from the fight waned. In it’s place, exhaustion bore as heavy a weight upon her mind as her bladder did on her body. Her head dipped and bobbed; her mind started to blank out and her muscles gradually relaxed.

The sound of a wolf’s howl suddenly rang out from close by - jolting her wide awake. Her feet caught one another, causing her to fall to the ground with a yelp. By twisting to her side, she managed to avoid landing directly on her swollen stomach, but a harsh pain shot through her nonetheless as she landed.

Bladder Strength: 20 (-5)

Bladder Capacity: 132/200 (-50)

“Gyah! Damn it! Get it together, Elira…” She let out a pained hiss as she slowly rose up only to double over as another wave of pain shot through her - her inner muscles struggling to regain control after the fall.

Bladder Strength: 17 (-8)

Bladder Capacity: 132/170 (-80)

What’s-happening-what’s-happening?!

Elira’s heart dropped as she watched those numbers start to plummet.

“N-No! P-Please! No!” She squealed desperately, her rock-hard bladder feeling as if it held enough to cause a small flood if she were to let it out now. The muscles that had been so laboriously holding back the tide suddenly felt as if they were made out of fragile paper!

Bladder Strength: 14 (-11)

Bladder Capacity: 133/140 (-110)

Tears began to spill down Elira’s cheeks. Any sense of fullness before couldn't compare to the sensation that she felt now. The mage well and truly thought she was about to explode in a golden shower! She dug her boots into the ground, toes clenched tightly together, squirming in an awkward shimmy while she squeezed at her poor loins.

Bladder Capacity: 132/140 (-110)

She felt it before her mind could even register that the number had gone down instead of up. A spurt of hot, pent-up urine gushed out from her strained urethra - soaking into her black panties.

No-NO!

Another spray of piss gushed out, now soaking her fingers through the fabric and leaving her panties utterly drenched.

Hold… it… Hoooold…. Iiiiit…

She clenched her teeth hard enough that she swore that they were going to shatter. Every muscle in her body coiled and tensed up like a wound spring as she focused every fiber of her being into keeping her bladder closed. And slowly…

Bladder Strength: 16 (-9)

Bladder Capacity: 132/160 (-90)

Bladder Strength: 20 (-5)

Bladder Capacity: 132/200 (-50)

Her bladder slowly started to recover - as best as it could in her current predicament anyway. Elira slowly sunk to her knees, falling gently over into a fetal position - gasping for air. Her hands remaining glued to her crotch.

She didn’t rest for long. She couldn’t. Not while her bladder continued to fill up. Slowly, she rose to her feet and continued onwards down the unlit path.

Bladder Strength: 25

Bladder Capacity: 200/250

At best, two hours remained before she would be forced to humiliate herself. Despite being pressed for time, Elira could feel herself growing sluggish. In addition to the sheer amount of piss now bloating her lower abdomen past what, frankly, should have been humanly possible for a bladder to expand to, she was now going on about twenty hours without rest. Having spent the last four or so of those hours just walking without much rest.

She had no idea how close to the village she was. She could have still been five hours out for all that she knew. All the Guidance spell told her was the general direction and the best path to take.

Elira hung her head in defeat, a hand basically kept fixed between her legs at all times at this point. Each step that she took sent a spasm coursing through her strained bladder that threatened to end her resistance right then and there.

Would it be so bad… if I just waited two hours… and pissed myself…

The thought crossed her mind constantly now. And each time she felt herself getting closer to considering that a valid option. No one would see. She could prestidigitation her clothes to remove all evidence and she could find a pond or something to wash up in before going to the village.

But her pride wouldn’t allow that. To say nothing of how she was reluctant to urinate over herself like a mere child, she had another reason. She knew something wanted her to do so.

These stats… and this ring now… It can't be a coincidence. It's all part of some twisted game…

She sweat dribbled on her brow, Elira letting her anger distract her from her impending disaster.

Whoever's toying with me… I won’t let them win…

…

But God would it feel good to pee… Even just a little bit...

She whimpered as a little dribble of urine leaked out from her burning hot urethra just from the thought, soaking into her panties once more. She lost track of how many times she had to cast Prestidigitation on them during this trek. And she could guess this would be far from the last time.

Elira brought her water-skin to her lips, watering her parched throat before giving it a shake. About half-full now… Which combined with the water-skin she had finished off earlier, meant that she was carrying close to two entire liters inside of her.

The mental image made her shiver, her hand falling to cradle at her bulging stomach.

“… This is stupid… I’m never going to make-” Elira began to mutter to herself before something caught her attention. The sound of hooves beating against the ground. She turned around, her night eyes able to catch the sight of a horse-drawn cart barreling down the path towards her.

“H-HEY!” She shouted, relief flooding her weary expression as she waved the rider down. Her bladder spasmed as she straightened up and keep her legs semi-spread. She wasn’t about to let some stranger know how close she was to wetting herself.

“… What in the hells are you doing out here at this hour?” The cart slowed to a crawl as it pulled up alongside Elira. The rider was a gruff older man with sun-kissed skin and shaggy black hair. The cart was filled with various crates, barrels and other goods with a torch fixed upon it to illuminate the way.

“Monster killer… Hunting contract…” She shook her head, her thighs subtly squeezing tighter together again. “Okay- Hey listen, you’re going to Redmare, right? Or at least passing through?”

The man gave a nod. “Should only be about an hour out from there - been riding fast to avoid any monsters or bandits. Gonna assume you’re going to ask for a ride, next?”

“As much as I am assuming that you would like a free bodyguard for the ride.” She flashed her hands and shadow-like flames formed at her palms. “You won't have to worry about being attacked on the road, I can promise you that.”

The rider squinted, staring at Elira for a few moments. A few moments that felt like ages as her bladder pulsated and throbbed with a maddening need for release.

“Alright. Don’t got any seats, but I think you can fit in somewhere in the back.” He thumbed over towards the small cart. “Name’s Aren.”

Thank God!

“Elira.” She nodded briskly, moving to climb on into the cart. It was hardly luxurious travel, being tucked in among various cargo. But it allowed her sore feet to recover. And better than that, she would be at the village - with potentially an hour to spare!

Bladder Capacity: 210/250

It only took a few minutes into the ride to dash Elira’s hopes of an easy last leg of the journey back to the village. She shook and bounced with every little bump in the path that they ran over. The sorceress nearly tumbling to one side as the cart veered a corner, then to the other with the next. The cart was clearly of a lesser quality than the wagon she had rode previously. And Aren was clearly in as much of a rush to get to the safety of a village as Elira was to empty her bladder.

That poor bladder - Elira could feel those litters of piping-hot piss sloshing around inside of her with every movement. Her skin was slick with sweat, toes and fingers clenched as she felt herself nearing her limit.

Another turn saw her tumbling awkwardly onto her side - a sharp jolt of pain coursing through her as her bladder compressed. An involuntary cry slipped from her lips as she fought to control her overly stretched bladder.

“A-Ah!”

Bladder Strength: 24 (-1)

Bladder Capacity: 212/240 (-10)

“Everything alright!?” Aren called out from out front - keeping his eyes on the road.

“Hit… my elbow…” She lied as easily as she breathed even as dread began to fill her heart. She reached down between her legs to squeeze desperately at her pussy. A few more drops of piss had leaked out to soak into her underwear. Only now, she would have to endure the wet sensation on her loins. Casting random spells would undoubtedly cast suspicion over her.

Elira couldn’t decide whether to ask him to slow down or go faster. Each choice seeming to hold a frightening amount of risk that ended up with her wetting herself on the back of a stranger’s cart. Her thoughts were interrupted as the cart came to a sudden halt, sending her tumbling forward into a crate.

“M-MGHHH!”

Bladder Strength: 23 (-2)

Bladder Capacity: 214/230 (-20)

“Goblins!”

Her urethra screamed in agony as it let out another squirt of urine, soaking in further into her panties. The sorceress blinking back tears as she struggled for control once more. Slowly, she opened her eyes and stood. Before the cart was three goblins - a small group wielding crude weapons and clubs.

Elira had no time for them. Abandoning any effort at conserving mana, she reached out to snuff out the lantern. The moment the light faded, she was gone, re-appearing some distance from the cart. The goblins barely had time to turn before shadows exploded from all around them. The sorceress quick to fire out three bolts afterwards to finish them off before quickly warping back into the cart and relighting the lantern.

“Taken care of. Go - Quickly!” A brief pause before she would quickly add. “Before more come!”

Aren stared at Elira with a gaping mouth before shaking his head and setting the cart down the path.

“… Think you should be taking on some higher-grade work than goblins with magic like that… Anyway, should be coming up on the village soon enough.”

God I hope so… Elira pursed her lips, her thighs squeezing for dear life as she braced herself for another bumpy ride.

Bladder Strength: 23 (-2)

Bladder Capacity: 227/230 (-20)

Elira had been in excruciating torment by the time they rolled into the Redmare stables. Every sudden bump and turn tested her limits, preventing her bladder from fully recovering as it had done from her little tumble before. By sheer will she had managed to keep it from weakening further. Even then, she had been contemplating just jumping out so that Aren wouldn’t see her piss herself.

“Looks like we made it-”

“Thank-you-have-a-good-night!” Elira quickly blurted out as she hopped out of the cart. The man left scratching at his head as she watched the sorceress hurriedly power-walk off towards the inn.

Bladder Capacity: 228/230 (-20)

Sweat drenched her outfit, clinging to her skin as she walked. Her entire lower region screamed at her for release. She could feel her piss-hole weakening with every passing second - she had mere minutes left if even that. Even the dryness of her throat taunted her, goading her for another sip from her water-skin. The past hour she had been able to deny herself if only because her hands were too preoccupied with steadying herself within the cart.

She rounded the corner to the back of the inn, marching towards the outhouse that laid behind it. A glint of metal adorned the door. A lock. The privy was reserved for guests of the inn - she knew this. Fortunately, she had already been staying at this inn for the past week. Her hand shot down into her pouch, pulling free the key to it.

Elira reached for the lock, pushing the key in only to stop. The lock was already open. She furrowed her brow, giving the handle a pull only to find it locked shut from the inside.

“O-Oh! Sorry! I’ll be just another minute!” A soft voice called out from within. And then, a moment later - the audible sound of hissing liquid splattering down into a hole could be heard.

Why is she using the bathroom at this hour!? Elira hissed and doubled over, squeezing tight at her groin with both hands. Her eyes shut as the sound of the woman relieving herself echoed in her, feeling as if a hammer was repeatedly being taken against her trembling bladder.

Bladder Capacity: 229/230 (-20)

“H…Hurry… please…” Her cheeks flushed - her desperation clear in her voice now as she danced restlessly on one leg. She was so close to making it! She couldn’t pee herself now - right when she was at the door!

The pissing soon stopped, and the door opened moments later - the woman inside seeming to have sensed that desperation and took it as a sign to pick up the pace.

“S-Sorry…” She murmured sheepishly, holding the door open for the darkly dressed magi.

Bladder Capacity: 230/230 (-20)

Elira barely so much as glanced at the woman’s way as she lunged inside. Her bladder started to give way, her urethra spasming as she briskly pulled her panties down - only just vaguely processing the sound of the woman closing the door behind her.

She had barely even managed to fully sit upon the seat as her floodgates burst open and urine began to stream violently out from within her. Her legs trembled and spread wide as it just kept coming, tears streaming from her eyes at the sheer relief that washed over her.

Bladder Capacity: 220/240 (-10)

Bladder Capacity: 200/250

Bladder Capacity: 180/250

Oh-my-god-oh-my-goooooooood~!

A wholly indecent moan slipped from her lips and her hands immediately shot up to cover her mouth. More soon followed, Elira unable to help but make such shameful sounds as her bladder shrunk and emptied. The release was pure and utter bliss - near orgasmic even. At that moment, the sound of all that hot liquid splattering down into the pit beneath her was the sweetest sound she had ever heard.

Bladder Capacity: 10/250

Bladder Capacity: 0/250

Elira felt as if she had been peeing for an eternity before the stream started to weaken and then dry up. Her eyelids fluttered open and close, her body on the verge of collapse now that she was no longer in a constant war with her bladder. Slowly she reached down to pull her panties up with sluggish speed and stand up, before freezing as she heard a sudden sound in her mind.

I… from-… from THAT?

Elira buried her face in her hands. Someone somewhere was truly taking the piss out of her. Some kind of sick joke at her expense. Now wasn’t the time to unpack all that though. The sorceress was well and truly exhausted and began to make her way up to her room. Her clothes carelessly tossed to the ground once she was inside until she stood in nothing more than her piss-stained panties. Without a care, she flopped face first into her bed - passing out almost immediately.

I tried posting Chapter Two Friday, but I think something went wrong and it never actually went through. Here's another attempt at posting it. TY all for the kind words and comments! 😄

Chapter Two

Bladder Capacity: 85/250

Elira hurriedly rushed through the darkened woods, coming to a halt as she found the spot that Gary had dropped her off. The dirt path that they had traveled on was not too much farther.

Fat chance of running into any other carriages - especially at this hour. The Sorceress grumbled. This route is constantly being ambushed by monsters. The camp that I cleared out must only be one of many.

She held at her abdomen, sighing as she felt at the liquid weight that she carried. A faint ‘silver-lining’ to the cursed ring if nothing else. Normally this amount of fluids would have her shimmy-dancing on the tips of her toes, but Elira felt like she could still go hours without peeing now.

“I’m fine… I’m fine…” Elira cleared her throat, which had become uncomfortably dry by now. She had refrained from drinking for the past hour in an effort to keep herself from filling up too fast, but her thirst was starting to win out over her better judgement.

Cursing her weakness, she dug into her pouch, pulling out another water skin and drank out from it, doing her best to not think about how all that water would soon be flowing towards her bladder.

She continued to drink as she walked, occasionally trading the water skin for some packed snacks. It was still the middle of the night. How she would have killed for an energy drink or a cup of coffee right about now. She estimated to have been awake for well over fourteen hours now.

Bladder Capacity: 105/250

She was reaching the four-hour point since she last relieved herself. Her features occasionally twisted into a wince whenever she made an odd step that jostled her bladder the wrong way.

“D-Damn it… Why is this happening…”

Elira whined, her voice coming out in heavy pants as she paused to lean against a tree. She was never exactly an athletic individual. Something that noticeably didn’t change even with her newfound ‘Heroine Stats’. Her legs ached almost as much as her bladder did from two hours of constant speed-walking. Sweat forming on her skin as she indulged in another deep sip of water.

Her bladder pushed past what normally would have been her limit. Even if she had plenty of capacity to spare, it was an uncomfortable feeling to be carrying so much liquid inside of her. She felt as she was going to burst at any moment! Elira groaned, leaning forward and shoving her hand deep into her crotch as her bladder pulsated desperately within.

“Stats say… I’m fine… I'm... fine…”

She chanted to herself, as if saying it repeatedly would make it any truer. Her focus shifting entirely towards just moving one foot after the next as she continued on down the path.

Bladder Capacity: 130/250

Elira panted heavily as she leaned against a tree, bouncing and swaying on one leg. The path behind her was littered with the corpses of goblins and wolves. She had been so distracted with keeping her bladder under control that she had walked into an ambush completely unaware. She had managed to handle them easily enough - though her bladder silently screamed at her with every cast of a spell.

“O-Ooohhh… C-Come on… I’m barely even… half-full…”

Elira’s eyes fluttered as the adrenaline from the fight waned. In it’s place, exhaustion bore as heavy a weight upon her mind as her bladder did on her body. Her head dipped and bobbed; her mind started to blank out and her muscles gradually relaxed.

The sound of a wolf’s howl suddenly rang out from close by - jolting her wide awake. Her feet caught one another, causing her to fall to the ground with a yelp. By twisting to her side, she managed to avoid landing directly on her swollen stomach, but a harsh pain shot through her nonetheless as she landed.

Bladder Capacity: 132/200 (-50)

“Gyah! Damn it! Get it together, Elira…” She let out a pained hiss as she slowly rose up only to double over as another wave of pain shot through her - her inner muscles struggling to regain control after the fall.

Bladder Strength: 17 (-8)

Bladder Capacity: 132/170 (-80)

What’s-happening-what’s-happening?!

Elira’s heart dropped as she watched those numbers start to plummet.

“N-No! P-Please! No!” She squealed desperately, her rock-hard bladder feeling as if it held enough to cause a small flood if she were to let it out now. The muscles that had been so laboriously holding back the tide suddenly felt as if they were made out of fragile paper!

Bladder Strength: 14 (-11)

Bladder Capacity: 133/140 (-110)

Tears began to spill down Elira’s cheeks. Any sense of fullness before couldn't compare to the sensation that she felt now. The mage well and truly thought she was about to explode in a golden shower! She dug her boots into the ground, toes clenched tightly together, squirming in an awkward shimmy while she squeezed at her poor loins.

Bladder Capacity: 132/140 (-110)

She felt it before her mind could even register that the number had gone down instead of up. A spurt of hot, pent-up urine gushed out from her strained urethra - soaking into her black panties.

No-NO!

Another spray of piss gushed out, now soaking her fingers through the fabric and leaving her panties utterly drenched.

Hold… it… Hoooold…. Iiiiit…

She clenched her teeth hard enough that she swore that they were going to shatter. Every muscle in her body coiled and tensed up like a wound spring as she focused every fiber of her being into keeping her bladder closed. And slowly…

Bladder Strength: 16 (-9)

Bladder Capacity: 132/160 (-90)

Bladder Strength: 20 (-5)

Bladder Capacity: 132/200 (-50)

Her bladder slowly started to recover - as best as it could in her current predicament anyway. Elira slowly sunk to her knees, falling gently over into a fetal position - gasping for air. Her hands remaining glued to her crotch.

She didn’t rest for long. She couldn’t. Not while her bladder continued to fill up. Slowly, she rose to her feet and continued onwards down the unlit path.

Bladder Strength: 25

Bladder Capacity: 200/250

At best, two hours remained before she would be forced to humiliate herself. Despite being pressed for time, Elira could feel herself growing sluggish. In addition to the sheer amount of piss now bloating her lower abdomen past what, frankly, should have been humanly possible for a bladder to expand to, she was now going on about twenty hours without rest. Having spent the last four or so of those hours just walking without much rest.

She had no idea how close to the village she was. She could have still been five hours out for all that she knew. All the Guidance spell told her was the general direction and the best path to take.

Elira hung her head in defeat, a hand basically kept fixed between her legs at all times at this point. Each step that she took sent a spasm coursing through her strained bladder that threatened to end her resistance right then and there.

Would it be so bad… if I just waited two hours… and pissed myself…

The thought crossed her mind constantly now. And each time she felt herself getting closer to considering that a valid option. No one would see. She could prestidigitation her clothes to remove all evidence and she could find a pond or something to wash up in before going to the village.

But her pride wouldn’t allow that. To say nothing of how she was reluctant to urinate over herself like a mere child, she had another reason. She knew something wanted her to do so.

These stats… and this ring now… It can't be a coincidence. It's all part of some twisted game…

She sweat dribbled on her brow, Elira letting her anger distract her from her impending disaster.

Whoever's toying with me… I won’t let them win…

…

But God would it feel good to pee… Even just a little bit...

She whimpered as a little dribble of urine leaked out from her burning hot urethra just from the thought, soaking into her panties once more. She lost track of how many times she had to cast Prestidigitation on them during this trek. And she could guess this would be far from the last time.

Elira brought her water-skin to her lips, watering her parched throat before giving it a shake. About half-full now… Which combined with the water-skin she had finished off earlier, meant that she was carrying close to two entire liters inside of her.

The mental image made her shiver, her hand falling to cradle at her bulging stomach.

“… This is stupid… I’m never going to make-” Elira began to mutter to herself before something caught her attention. The sound of hooves beating against the ground. She turned around, her night eyes able to catch the sight of a horse-drawn cart barreling down the path towards her.

“H-HEY!” She shouted, relief flooding her weary expression as she waved the rider down. Her bladder spasmed as she straightened up and keep her legs semi-spread. She wasn’t about to let some stranger know how close she was to wetting herself.

“… What in the hells are you doing out here at this hour?” The cart slowed to a crawl as it pulled up alongside Elira. The rider was a gruff older man with sun-kissed skin and shaggy black hair. The cart was filled with various crates, barrels and other goods with a torch fixed upon it to illuminate the way.

“Monster killer… Hunting contract…” She shook her head, her thighs subtly squeezing tighter together again. “Okay- Hey listen, you’re going to Redmare, right? Or at least passing through?”

The man gave a nod. “Should only be about an hour out from there - been riding fast to avoid any monsters or bandits. Gonna assume you’re going to ask for a ride, next?”

“As much as I am assuming that you would like a free bodyguard for the ride.” She flashed her hands and shadow-like flames formed at her palms. “You won't have to worry about being attacked on the road, I can promise you that.”

The rider squinted, staring at Elira for a few moments. A few moments that felt like ages as her bladder pulsated and throbbed with a maddening need for release.

“Alright. Don’t got any seats, but I think you can fit in somewhere in the back.” He thumbed over towards the small cart. “Name’s Aren.”

Thank God!

“Elira.” She nodded briskly, moving to climb on into the cart. It was hardly luxurious travel, being tucked in among various cargo. But it allowed her sore feet to recover. And better than that, she would be at the village - with potentially an hour to spare!

Bladder Capacity: 210/250

It only took a few minutes into the ride to dash Elira’s hopes of an easy last leg of the journey back to the village. She shook and bounced with every little bump in the path that they ran over. The sorceress nearly tumbling to one side as the cart veered a corner, then to the other with the next. The cart was clearly of a lesser quality than the wagon she had rode previously. And Aren was clearly in as much of a rush to get to the safety of a village as Elira was to empty her bladder.

That poor bladder - Elira could feel those litters of piping-hot piss sloshing around inside of her with every movement. Her skin was slick with sweat, toes and fingers clenched as she felt herself nearing her limit.

Another turn saw her tumbling awkwardly onto her side - a sharp jolt of pain coursing through her as her bladder compressed. An involuntary cry slipped from her lips as she fought to control her overly stretched bladder.

“A-Ah!”

Bladder Strength: 24 (-1)

Bladder Capacity: 212/240 (-10)

“Everything alright!?” Aren called out from out front - keeping his eyes on the road.

“Hit… my elbow…” She lied as easily as she breathed even as dread began to fill her heart. She reached down between her legs to squeeze desperately at her pussy. A few more drops of piss had leaked out to soak into her underwear. Only now, she would have to endure the wet sensation on her loins. Casting random spells would undoubtedly cast suspicion over her.

Elira couldn’t decide whether to ask him to slow down or go faster. Each choice seeming to hold a frightening amount of risk that ended up with her wetting herself on the back of a stranger’s cart. Her thoughts were interrupted as the cart came to a sudden halt, sending her tumbling forward into a crate.

“M-MGHHH!”

Bladder Strength: 23 (-2)

Bladder Capacity: 214/230 (-20)

“Goblins!”

Her urethra screamed in agony as it let out another squirt of urine, soaking in further into her panties. The sorceress blinking back tears as she struggled for control once more. Slowly, she opened her eyes and stood. Before the cart was three goblins - a small group wielding crude weapons and clubs.

Elira had no time for them. Abandoning any effort at conserving mana, she reached out to snuff out the lantern. The moment the light faded, she was gone, re-appearing some distance from the cart. The goblins barely had time to turn before shadows exploded from all around them. The sorceress quick to fire out three bolts afterwards to finish them off before quickly warping back into the cart and relighting the lantern.

“Taken care of. Go - Quickly!” A brief pause before she would quickly add. “Before more come!”

Aren stared at Elira with a gaping mouth before shaking his head and setting the cart down the path.

“… Think you should be taking on some higher-grade work than goblins with magic like that… Anyway, should be coming up on the village soon enough.”

God I hope so… Elira pursed her lips, her thighs squeezing for dear life as she braced herself for another bumpy ride.

Bladder Strength: 23 (-2)

Bladder Capacity: 227/230 (-20)

Elira had been in excruciating torment by the time they rolled into the Redmare stables. Every sudden bump and turn tested her limits, preventing her bladder from fully recovering as it had done from her little tumble before. By sheer will she had managed to keep it from weakening further. Even then, she had been contemplating just jumping out so that Aren wouldn’t see her piss herself.

“Looks like we made it-”

“Thank-you-have-a-good-night!” Elira quickly blurted out as she hopped out of the cart. The man left scratching at his head as she watched the sorceress hurriedly power-walk off towards the inn.

Bladder Capacity: 228/230 (-20)

Sweat drenched her outfit, clinging to her skin as she walked. Her entire lower region screamed at her for release. She could feel her piss-hole weakening with every passing second - she had mere minutes left if even that. Even the dryness of her throat taunted her, goading her for another sip from her water-skin. The past hour she had been able to deny herself if only because her hands were too preoccupied with steadying herself within the cart.

She rounded the corner to the back of the inn, marching towards the outhouse that laid behind it. A glint of metal adorned the door. A lock. The privy was reserved for guests of the inn - she knew this. Fortunately, she had already been staying at this inn for the past week. Her hand shot down into her pouch, pulling free the key to it.

Elira reached for the lock, pushing the key in only to stop. The lock was already open. She furrowed her brow, giving the handle a pull only to find it locked shut from the inside.

“O-Oh! Sorry! I’ll be just another minute!” A soft voice called out from within. And then, a moment later - the audible sound of hissing liquid splattering down into a hole could be heard.

Why is she using the bathroom at this hour!? Elira hissed and doubled over, squeezing tight at her groin with both hands. Her eyes shut as the sound of the woman relieving herself echoed in her, feeling as if a hammer was repeatedly being taken against her trembling bladder.

Bladder Capacity: 229/230 (-20)

“H…Hurry… please…” Her cheeks flushed - her desperation clear in her voice now as she danced restlessly on one leg. She was so close to making it! She couldn’t pee herself now - right when she was at the door!

The pissing soon stopped, and the door opened moments later - the woman inside seeming to have sensed that desperation and took it as a sign to pick up the pace.

“S-Sorry…” She murmured sheepishly, holding the door open for the darkly dressed magi.

Bladder Capacity: 230/230 (-20)

Elira barely so much as glanced at the woman’s way as she lunged inside. Her bladder started to give way, her urethra spasming as she briskly pulled her panties down - only just vaguely processing the sound of the woman closing the door behind her.

She had barely even managed to fully sit upon the seat as her floodgates burst open and urine began to stream violently out from within her. Her legs trembled and spread wide as it just kept coming, tears streaming from her eyes at the sheer relief that washed over her.

Bladder Capacity: 220/240 (-10)

Bladder Capacity: 200/250

Bladder Capacity: 180/250

Oh-my-god-oh-my-goooooooood~!

A wholly indecent moan slipped from her lips and her hands immediately shot up to cover her mouth. More soon followed, Elira unable to help but make such shameful sounds as her bladder shrunk and emptied. The release was pure and utter bliss - near orgasmic even. At that moment, the sound of all that hot liquid splattering down into the pit beneath her was the sweetest sound she had ever heard.

Bladder Capacity: 10/250

Bladder Capacity: 0/250

Elira felt as if she had been peeing for an eternity before the stream started to weaken and then dry up. Her eyelids fluttered open and close, her body on the verge of collapse now that she was no longer in a constant war with her bladder. Slowly she reached down to pull her panties up with sluggish speed and stand up, before freezing as she heard a sudden sound in her mind.

Elira buried her face in her hands. Someone somewhere was truly taking the piss out of her. Some kind of sick joke at her expense. Now wasn’t the time to unpack all that though. The sorceress was well and truly exhausted and began to make her way up to her room. Her clothes carelessly tossed to the ground once she was inside until she stood in nothing more than her piss-stained panties. Without a care, she flopped face first into her bed - passing out almost immediately.
