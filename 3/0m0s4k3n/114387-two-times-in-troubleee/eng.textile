Two-Time was basically the type of Cultist to be very known as a Person who sacrifices their Best Friend for a Second Life,But they would never expect to meet Him Again,Through an embarrassing situation..

Two-Time was basically in a round,Looking where to plant their ritual,But the killer was…Azure..?

Wait no..I-I thought..?! H-How is He..?! H-How..?

”…” Two-Time shrugged it off as something and went to plant their ritual,But then the twinge in their bladder made them stop mid way to where they would plant their ritual

”..?” Two-Time laid a hand on their Bladder and pressed it softly,They let out a little “eep!” Since they have a sensitive bladder,Why during a round..?!

“I guess I’ll have to hold it this round..T-The spawn would find it unworthy of me to pee myself..Right here.” Two-Time finally planted their ritual near a corner and then began walking around for Generators to finish,Having to stop a few times to push their bladder softly due to the twinges

After completing one,Two-Time just began walking around for another one,Getting nearly chased by Azure and having to pause when about to Dagger on Azure had made them uncomfortable..

It reminded them of the past in which they couldn’t fix at all..

Right when Two-Time sank into their deepest thoughts,Azure took it as an Opportunity to grab Two-Time by the legs,Not knowing their predicament

Before Shedletsky could yell at Two-Time to watch out,The tentacle grabbed them by the leg,Which snapped them out of their deep thoughts through a gasp

”TWO-TIME!!” Everyone Gasped as Two-Time got taken into the air by Azure,Guess he was stuck like that till death…No control over their bladder now I guess..(Possibly huge Bladder Control issues lol-)

Two-Time was now stuck upside down with a bladder that’s nearly full,Two-Time honestly didn’t even care from the looks,They could handle being stuck and all..Right?

”T-Two Time..! A-Are you ok..?!” Noob shouted from below “D-Dont worry about me..! I-I’ve got A-Azure..! T-The spawn will protect you all I-I’m sure..!” Two-Time screamed from above,Thinking that they could handle being stuck in the air for 3 minutes..

”Y-yeah your stuck like that for maybe..3 minutes you know?” Elliot Added “Are you really sure you’ll be fine like that?” Two-Time Nodded,Not knowing the consequences to doing so “Y-Yes..! I-I’ll be alright..!”

“Alright,If you say so..” Elliot replied,Two-Time sighed as the others moved away to work on Generators,They remembered Builderman said they would try to find a way to get them down

But atleast for now…They were stuck upside down..Their bladder was getting more liquid than usual,Possibly because of their Water Control..

Azure kept Two-Time in His tentacles for…longer than they’ve expected,He’d usually find it just a few seconds before the person grabbed by it would get dropped onto the floor like some voodoo doll

But this was longer than they’d expect,It’s been 20 seconds,Azure hasn’t put them down yet,30 seconds,Still nothing,40 Seconds? You’ve guessed it,Nothing!

Two-Time shifted Occasionally in Azure’s Grip,Having to pee while distracting Azure from their teammates felt rather..weird,(No No-There was one where Two-Time once got dragged by a hooky and had to distract 1x with that Opportunity-)

Azure kept Two-Time like this for awhile,Two-Time felt their bladder getting more full,Almost like they might leak sooner or later

It kept getting worse and worse each time,Two-Time didn’t wanna take it as an opportunity,They were embarrassed enough..!

Azure saw it as an opportunity himself though,He moved the tentacle toward Two-Time’s chest and then began tapping their bladder with the other tentacle

Two-Time shrieked and couldn’t do anything but watch as Azure pressed their bladder,They might leak now..! Thanks to them…

Two-Time had to stay upside down for 2 minutes straight up before they leaked a bit,”!!” Their hands were shifted inside the tentacle’s grip,So if they moved it close enough they could possibly hold their bladder to prevent more leaks..!

Straight to that plan,Two-Time began shifting their arms toward their crotch,Before they reached it,And Two-Time took it as an opportunity and shifted their hands into their crotch,Holding it tightly,But Azure took notice of it and moved their hands back away and just closed the tentacle gap,”Now Now Two-Time..Don’t get Any ideas..~”

Two-Time cursed under their breath and began shifting often again,Azure kept booping their bladder nonstop,The leaks got bigger,There’s probably a stain on their Undergarments now..No way those were close to dry now..And those were their favorite pair…

Two-Time kept feeling the leaks get gradually more bigger,Then the final Generator had been finished,And now they knew everyone was gonna rush to help them now..Thank god..

Two-Time then tried to grab their Dagger,But it was to tight for them to reach into their pocket to grab it,Two-Time sighed and realized they were stuck like this for real,But then Azure’s Tentacle began gripping tighter than usual

Then they felt their thighs get wetter,Two-Time was leaking,They whimpered and twitched their legs closer to their crotch,They couldn’t last any longer…!

Even if it’s 3 minutes..T-The Dam’s breakinggg..!!!-Everyone finally made it near Two-Time and Shedletsky sighed “How will we get you down..” “Oh maybe we could try shooting the tentacles!” “Yeah no..We might hit Two-Time..” “Shit..-“ “Or maybe I could just tickle him..?” How,His tentacles took him up..” “What about we save Two-Time first before we strike at Azure?” “That’s what we’re planning right now,Elliot..” “Ah right..” “As a pumpkin,I recommend we try to throw stuff at Azure,That’s my Recommendation.” “Do you always have to rhy-Never mind…” “TWO-TIME WERE COMING FOR YOUUUU!!!!!”

Two-Time felt a sense of hope as Shedletsky Yelled that they were coming for Them..! They’re finally saved! And they can go to the bathroom..!! Finally..!~

But Two-Time’s Hopes got caught off when Azure pressed Two-Time’s bladder again,Causing them to leak,Two-Time didn’t know how much longer they could control it..

At this rate they’ll…

”C-CAN YOU GUYS HURRY UP…?! I-I HAVE TO PEE..!!!!!!!-“

Two-Time couldn’t believe they yelled that out loud..Elliot went Blushing,Noob covered his Face and was completely silent.Shedletsky Paused with their sword in hand,Builderman’s Jaw dropped,007n7 stood in shock,Guest 1337 turned very more serious,Taph was making weird hand signals,Dusekkar was basically frozen in place and blushing,And Chance just smirked,Causing Elliot to smack him

”Ow! Hey that hurt Elli!!” “Dont smirk at them! It’s urgent!” Two-Time had been completely blushing,Wanting to hide in a corner and cry

”T-Two-Time,How long have you been holding it for..?” “T-The whole round..” “WHAT?! You could’ve gotten an infection!” “W-Why did you have to tell us now..?”

Two-Time didn’t say anything,They were at the verge of tears,Their bladder was screaming at them to let go now..! Before it did it itself..

”Alright so this is interesting..” Shedletsky quietly Mumbled,Messing with their sword a little,Before then He dashed toward the tentacle and Slashed it,Azure screamed and then placed down another tentacle,That caused Two-Time to leak,They were sure that there was a wet spot on their pants now…

Azure’s Grip tightened each time some sentinel hit his tentacles,Then Two-Time’s bladder completely lost it..Then Two-Time felt the floodgates open.

HSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

Everyone turned their heads to face Two-Time,Only to find pee streaming down Two-Time’s Body,It soaked their shirt and body,Two-Time went completely red,Tears streaming down their face,They shook their head and closed their eyes,that’s when Azure took it all as an opportunity and slowly began unzipping Two-Time’s Pants

Two-time paused and looked at where their pants were,They noticed that the tentacles moved up to their knees,And then,Azure pulled Two-Time’s pants slowly,Exposing their wet undergarments(It would have the spawn on it,No joke🙂)

This added more to Two-Time’s Embarrassment,Two-Time wanted to go to his room and sob but no,He was stuck in this mess,Soaked and exposed.

Then Shedletsky immediately slashed the last tentacles twice,Causing Azure to fall,And Two-Time to be put down,Guest noticed and immediately caught them,Two-Time was now in Guest 1337’s arms,

Azure fell in Two-Time’s Puddle,And then Immediately Chance shot them in the head,Azure fell back and sat there

”You ok Two-Time? That must’ve been..Embarrassing..” “That was a Jackpot!” “Chance..Atleast have some sympathy for Two-Time..It was embarrassing for them..” “Ah right..Thought you ok Two-Time?”

Two-Time’s heart was thumping,Their cheeks were streaked with tears,They couldn’t move at all,Their body felt numb.

All Two-Time could do was whimper and sob in Guest’s Arms

”I-I’m so sorry..I-I failed you all…” “N-No No..! Y-You didn’t fail us..! I-It’s Azure..!-“ “The spawn wont find me worthy anymoreeee..*Sob*” “Heey cheer up,I’m sure that whoever that..Spawn is,I’m sure they’ll still find you worthy,Even over an accident!”

“Ok here..How about this? Once this round ends,You take a shower and then you can come help us again,Your gonna rest..hmm..3 rounds maybe..” “T-Thanks Guest..B-But I don’t know if I’m worthy of the spawn anymore..” “The Spawn still finds you like that..! I’ll hope..”

Builderman knew Two-Time wasn’t the type of person to be exposed,So he took off his jacket and gave it to them

”Here,You’ll need it..” “T-Thanks..T-The spawn blesses you for your kindness…” “Ah shut up,The timer’s gonna end soon!” “O-Oh Ok..”

Then the timer reached Zero,Causing the survivors to all be teleported into the Cabin,Two-Time carefully got off Guest’s Hands and went into the Bathroom,No words

“Wait What about my Hoo-“

{THE END!}
