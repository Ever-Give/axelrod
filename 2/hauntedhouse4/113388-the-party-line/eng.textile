The Party Line – Part One

The music was loud, the air heavy with the scent of beer, sweat, and cheap perfume. The house pulsed with bodies dancing and laughing—except for the narrow hallway outside the only bathroom. There, four girls stood in various stages of desperation, arms crossed, legs trembling, and eyes fixed on the locked door like it was their salvation.

Inside the bathroom, Jacob sat on the closed toilet lid, pants damp and balled up in the corner. His head rested in his hands.

“Jacob, please,” Maya called through the door, knocking once more, trying to keep her voice steady. “This isn’t funny. Just unlock the door, okay?”

Jacob didn’t answer. He was too humiliated. The warm shame of what he’d done—what they all saw—still clung to him like the wet fabric had. The laughter. The flash of camera phones. Someone yelling, “Dude, did he actually piss himself?” And then the running, the slamming of the door, the lock twisting shut.

Maya banged the door harder, then stepped back, groaning. “Ugh. I can’t hold it much longer.” She crossed her arms over her stomach, the tattoos on her forearms flexing. Her tight, low-rise jeans didn’t help—the pressure of the waistband made it worse. Her black sports bra was slick with sweat, and she was clearly past frustrated.

Behind her, Melissa let out an exaggerated sigh. “He’s not coming out. Why don’t we just break it down or something?”

“You gonna kick it in, princess?” Avril said, biting her lip, one hand pressed hard into her thigh. She bounced slightly, like moving might help. Her tight black leggings hugged her hips, showing every twitch and tremble.

Maya glanced back at them. “You think I don’t want to? I’m dying here.”

Sarah, in line behind Avril, whimpered. Her see-through white T-shirt clung to her body, and she kept shifting uncomfortably, trying to pull it down over her booty shorts. It was no use. Every guy who passed made a comment. “Nice shirt,” or, “Damn, Sarah’s showing out tonight.” She didn’t feel hot—just exposed and helpless. She crossed her legs tightly and blinked back tears.

“I’m gonna pee myself,” Avril whispered suddenly, her voice cracking. “I swear. I almost did on the way here.”

The group went silent for a moment. None of them wanted to admit it, but they all were close. Too close.

Maya pressed her forehead against the door. “Jacob, please. You’re not the only one who’s embarrassed.”

Still no answer.

Melissa shifted, biting her lip. “You think you’re embarrassed, Jacob?” she called. “Last month, I was hooking up with this guy after a party. We were making out on the couch, and I couldn’t leave to pee ‘cause I didn’t want to kill the mood. I thought I could hold it.”

She paused, then gave a half-laugh. “I couldn’t. I straight-up peed on the dude’s leg. He didn’t say anything, just got up and left. I cried the whole night. So, trust me, I get it.”

Avril looked over. “Seriously?”

Melissa nodded. “Dead serious.”

Avril groaned. “Shit… Okay. Fine. I’ll go next. Last week, I was in the library pulling an all-nighter. I had like, two energy drinks and a coffee. And I didn’t want to leave my laptop, y’know? So I waited and waited…”

She trailed off, pressing both hands between her thighs now, visibly shaking.

“…and then I sneezed. Just one. That was all it took. It soaked through my jeans. Had to tie my hoodie around my waist and sneak out. I haven't been back since.”

Sarah sniffled behind them. Her tears were quiet, but they were real. “I was at the boardwalk,” she said softly. “Just… walking around with friends. We were drinking. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to sound like a baby. I kept thinking there’d be a bathroom nearby.”

Her eyes stared blankly down the hall.

“I didn’t make it. Right in the sand. Everyone saw. Some guy called me ‘piss shorts’ when I went to get a slice.”

Maya turned, looking back at them all. “Why are we pretending like this doesn’t happen to everyone? He’s just scared. Like we were.”

She banged once more, less angry this time. “Jacob, you’re not alone, okay?”

Inside the bathroom, Jacob’s breath hitched. He had heard every word. His chest ached, but somehow, it also felt lighter. His hands slowly unclenched.

“I’m not coming out,” he said finally, his voice hoarse. “I can’t.”

“You can,” Maya said gently. “We’ve all been there. You heard us.”

There was a pause. Then the sound of the lock clicking.

Everyone froze.

The door creaked open a few inches. Jacob didn’t look out, but his voice came through, trembling.

“You’ll… you’ll cover me? Like, just… get me out of here?”

Maya nodded, even though he couldn’t see it. “Yeah. We’ve got you.”

Jacob stepped back, out of view. Maya pushed the door open and slipped inside, closing it behind her.

In the hallway, Avril doubled over, clutching herself.

“I’m next,” she cried. “Please. I can’t wait anymore!”

Melissa and Sarah both turned away, trying not to look as she bent her knees and crossed her legs. The dam was breaking—literally.

Maya opened the door a minute later, one arm wrapped protectively around Jacob’s shoulders. His eyes were red, but dry. He wore a long jacket someone had left on the counter.

“Go,” Maya said to the others. “It’s open.”

Avril didn’t even hesitate. She rushed in, slamming the door behind her with a muffled sob.

Melissa and Sarah stared after her, shaking. The line was moving again, but no one would forget what had happened in that hallway.

Part Two coming soon 🙂

Part 2:

Maya leaned against the wall, exhaling through gritted teeth. Her bladder throbbed. Getting Jacob out had taken every ounce of composure she had left, and now that she was back, the line was somehow longer. She hadn’t even peed.

The hallway buzzed with tension. Sarah stood rigid near the door, arms wrapped around her stomach, face blotchy from crying. Melissa paced in tight circles, chewing at a thumbnail. Neither girl had budged since Maya left—and neither had the door to the bathroom.

“What is taking so long?” Melissa hissed, knocking hard. “Avril! Come on, girl. There’s like ten of us out here now!”

No response.

Melissa’s tone sharpened. “Are you okay in there? This isn’t funny!”

Still nothing.

Sarah’s legs were trembling. Her white T-shirt clung damply to her back, and she kept yanking it down as if that would make her feel less seen. “If she doesn’t open that door in ten seconds, I’m going in. I swear, I can’t take this anymore.”

Maya frowned. “Try the handle. See if it’s locked.”

Melissa grabbed it, twisted. Still locked. She turned to the group. “She went in like fifteen minutes ago. What the hell is she doing in there?”

Maya’s stomach sank. A new wave of urgency hit her hard. She gritted her teeth and forced herself to stay composed, but her thighs were pressed tight together, her arms crossed below her chest in a poor attempt to hide how badly she needed to go. She scanned the hallway for options, but there were none—just bodies packed tighter than before, and whispers behind hands as people realized Maya had returned and was now… in line again.

Sarah’s voice broke through the noise. “She knows we’re waiting. Why isn’t she answering?”

“I don’t know,” Melissa snapped, rapping again. “Avril, are you okay? Say something!”

From inside, nothing. No movement, no flush, not even a cough.

Maya’s heart pounded. Something didn’t feel right. Not just panic over her own situation—but a twist in her gut that told her something was off.

Then Sarah lost it.

“This is BULLSHIT!” she screamed, stomping toward the door, fists clenched. “Does she want us to wet ourselves?! I’m not doing this! I’m not gonna be the next joke at this party!”

She slammed her hand on the door. “OPEN UP! Please! Please, I can’t—”

Maya stepped forward. “Sarah. Hey. Breathe, okay?”

“I can’t breathe!” Sarah sobbed, doubled over. “I’m gonna have an accident in front of everyone and my shirt’s see-through and this is gonna ruin my whole life! Please just get her out!”

Maya took her by the shoulders and gently guided her back, trying to mask her own trembling knees. “Let’s stay calm. We’ll figure this out.”

Behind them, the line murmured. A guy nearby laughed nervously, but most people looked just as uncomfortable as the girls. Some shifted side to side, others crossed their legs or left in search of other bathrooms that didn’t exist.

Melissa was done playing games. “We’re opening it.”

Maya’s eyes widened. “Wait—what if she’s changing or something?”

“For fifteen minutes? With no answer?” Melissa grabbed a plastic hairpin from her pocket. “I’m unlocking it.”

Sarah whimpered, hugging herself. Maya, feeling the warmth of panic rising in her chest—and lower—didn’t stop her.

It took a minute. Melissa jiggled the pin in the lock, swore under her breath, then suddenly—the latch popped.

She threw open the door.

And froze.

Inside, Avril sat on the closed toilet lid, fully clothed, arms around her knees, face buried in her lap. Her T-shirt was soaked. Her leggings too. The floor beneath her shimmered under the fluorescent light.

“Avril…” Melissa breathed.

She didn’t move.

Maya stepped in slowly, the smell hitting her—sharp, unmistakable. Avril had lost it completely. And now she was hiding in the worst place possible.

“Avril,” Maya said gently, kneeling despite the throbbing in her bladder. “It’s okay. Just… come with me, okay?”

Avril shook her head.

“I—I didn’t mean to,” she whispered. “It started before I could sit down. I didn’t want anyone to see…”

Sarah peeked in, then recoiled, covering her mouth.

“Oh my god,” Melissa muttered. “She’s been in there this whole time because…”

“Because she was humiliated,” Maya said, voice firm. “Like all of us have been.”

She helped Avril up, wrapping an arm around her soaked waist.

“Back up,” Maya ordered the crowd. “Give her space.”

The hallway parted. No laughter this time. No comments. Just stunned silence.

Melissa watched them go, blinking rapidly. “She couldn’t even… get her pants down?”

“She tried,” Maya said. “But it was too late.”

Sarah whispered, “It’s about to be too late for me…”

She clutched the wall, shaking from head to toe.

Melissa spun on her. “Go. Go now. You’re next.”

Sarah darted in, slamming the door.

Maya turned back to the hallway, helping Avril down the stairs toward the laundry room. People moved out of their way. Some turned away. Others looked at Maya like she was something other than the girl in line—something stronger. She didn’t feel that way. Not when every step reminded her how close she was to soaking her jeans in front of everyone.

Melissa leaned against the wall outside the bathroom, arms crossed, jaw tight.

The hallway was quiet again. But the pressure hadn’t lifted.

If anything, it was building.

Part Three- Final Part-

The hallway felt like it had closed in, thick with desperation, the heavy scent of sweat, spilled drinks—and something else. The door to the bathroom was still shut, though they could hear the sound of water and Sarah quietly crying on the other side.

Maya stood at the back of the line now, hips rocking subtly, one hand planted firmly between her thighs. She looked like she was trying not to moan, and truthfully, the pressure against her crotch reminded her of late nights under the covers when her fingers knew what to do and her breath caught for entirely different reasons.

But now it was just survival.

She bit down hard on her lip.

Melissa stood two spots ahead, her arms stiff at her sides. Her pacing had stopped. She wasn’t moving at all anymore—she just stared ahead, like if she didn’t acknowledge how bad it was, her body might forget too.

And then came a quiet whimper from somewhere just behind Melissa.

Jessica.

Maya hadn’t noticed her join the line. She was a petite girl with soft features and thick-framed glasses. Her jeans clung tightly to her legs, and her hoodie was zipped up high, the sleeves stretched over her hands. She looked younger than most of the others, and there was something in the way she stood that made Maya think this wasn’t her first time like this.

“Please…” Jessica whispered, more to herself than anyone else.

Melissa turned just as Jessica let out a sharp gasp.

A growing stain bloomed across the front of Jessica’s jeans, dark and immediate. Her body collapsed in on itself as she dropped to a crouch, urine splashing out beneath her, soaking her shoes and puddling on the hardwood floor.

“I can’t—I couldn’t—” she choked, tears running down her cheeks. “I have diabetes… I couldn’t hold it…”

The sound was horrible—soft hissing, crying, splashing. Everyone froze.

And then Melissa’s face changed.

Her whole body twitched once. Her hands shot to her crotch. “No… no no no no—”

A second later, a flood burst from her own jeans. It poured down both legs, streaming over her thighs, soaking into her shoes with a sickening warmth. Her mouth dropped open in shock, then snapped shut as she let out a sob—sharp and animal.

“OH MY GOD,” she shrieked, staggering backward, the back of her jeans glistening.

Just then, a guy walking past caught the scene.

He stopped mid-step, burst out laughing, and pointed.

“Holy SHIT, are you serious? What are you, five years old? You nasty ass BITCH—go home!”

Melissa’s face turned crimson. Her hands trembled at her sides, dripping. She was soaked, standing in a puddle that connected to Jessica’s, and the humiliation spread across her face like wildfire.

Jessica was still crying, crouched low in shame, arms over her knees.

And Maya… Maya thought she might scream.

She couldn't take it anymore.

The sound, the smell, the way her bladder screamed—it was too much. She crossed her legs tighter and pressed her hand harder between them, but the pressure wasn’t helping anymore. The whole world had narrowed to one primal need, and she was on the edge of breaking.

She whimpered softly, shaking.

At that moment, the bathroom door creaked open.

Sarah stepped out, pale and dazed. Her T-shirt clung to her chest, still see-through, but her eyes were hollow like she’d just walked out of a war zone.

She took one look at Melissa and Jessica and stepped aside silently.

The bathroom was open.

But Maya didn’t move.

She couldn’t.

Her knees buckled, and for a second, she thought it was already happening. That she was going to lose it in front of everyone. In front of the guy who’d laughed. In front of the line that kept watching.

She turned and bolted.

Out the hallway. Down the stairs. Through the crowded living room.

People turned, some laughing, others confused.

Maya didn’t care.

She slammed through the back door, stumbled into the dark yard lit by string lights, and sprinted behind a hedge, gasping for air.

But it was already too late.

It started as a trickle.

Then a rush.

Hot urine burst into her jeans, soaking through the denim instantly. It ran down her thighs, into her boots, pooling in the grass below. She cried out, tried to stop it, clenching with everything she had—but her body didn’t care. It was done.

By the time she could move again, the damage was total. Her jeans clung to her skin, cold and wet and mortifying.

She stumbled to her car, fumbled for the keys, yanked the door open, and collapsed into the driver’s seat of her Camaro.

She slammed the door shut and screamed.

Her face twisted into sobs she couldn’t control.

Not after everything she’d done—helping Jacob, comforting Avril, keeping people calm.

And still, this.

Still, she ended up here, soaking wet and humiliated in her own car at a party she didn’t even want to be at.

She dropped her head to the steering wheel and sobbed until her throat burned.

No one came looking for her.

And Maya didn’t go back inside.
