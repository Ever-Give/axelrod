Long time no post! This is a little fantasy desperation fetish story I wrote. It was originally supposed to be a comic, but I'm a pretty slow artist, so now it's a story with occasional pictures lol. I've got lots of characters and lots of scenarios, so I'll share them all bit by bit. There's even some romance involved ^^ I'd love to read your comments and suggestions. Please support my very unlucky fairy girl.

————————

In the forest by Littlestream Town, there are fairies. They are rare, beautiful creatures that protect the forest. Their magical powers are so immense, even their urine has miracle healing properties. As a result, fairies are highly sought after by hunters.

This is the story of one such fairy who wishes to live a peaceful life.

She kneels behind the brambles, hiding herself. Her bare legs squeeze together tight and shift around in the grass. It isn’t safe to venture out yet—she can still hear the clamor of the hunting party nearby. She’s in a bit of a panic, so she can’t figure out which direction the noise is coming from. When will they leave her alone? There’s no privacy in the forest lately…

She hears a twig snap not too far behind her, and her whole body tightens up. She turns her head cautiously—slowly—as if the threat will only become real once she acknowledges it. She sees a group of grizzly hunters, weapons in hand, staring her down.

She almost wets herself in fright.

She’s up in an instant, and she makes a mad dash into the wind. The hunters pursue her, hollering all the while, but with a flutter of her sparkling teal-colored wings, she’s light as air, and much quicker than them. She flies deeper into the forest, but she can’t manage her way back to safe fairy territory. Her only choice is to find a suitably dense bush to use as cover. In fact, she barely makes it much further at all before she has to land, collapse back onto her knees, and whine in frustration.

The reason this fairy is doing such an awful job at escaping these hunters is because she needs to pee badly.

Fairies typically leave their inner territory in order to relieve themselves. The center of their territory is full of lush wildlife, a paradise of dewy plants and flowers teeming with magic, and it’s considered faux pas to do unsanitary things there. Usually, a fairy flies to the outer edge of their territory to pee, and their magic provides nourishment to the land that eventually extends fairy territory into that area. Lately, though, hunters have caught onto this, and they’ve been appearing at the edge of the territory to snatch up fairies when they’re most vulnerable. Fairy territory has been shrinking, and safe places to relieve themselves become fewer and fewer. This is the problem plaguing this unfortunate fairy.

She’s chased relentlessly, and she can’t pee. She had already held it till the last minute, on account of how much she feared the hunters in the area, and then she ended up being spotted. She's so desperate that she's flying crooked, and can only manage it in short bursts, before she has to land and devote all her energy to holding it in. Because of that, the hunters are always right on her tail, and she can't escape. It’s not like she can quickly pee while she’s hiding, either—if the hunters spot a puddle, it’ll only attract more of them in the future.

Besides, there’s no time! The fairy crams her delicate hands in between her thighs and rocks her hips back and forth, breathing through her teeth. She needs to pee torturously badly, but she can’t. It’s only mere seconds of hiding, this time, before she hears rustling in the bushes behind her. No, please, not yet! A spurt of piss escapes the terrified girl, and soaks her fingers. She didn’t have time to recover her strength or get her bladder under control at all. Desperate to escape, she crawls frantically on her hands and knees, pee dribbling down her creamy thighs. In all the commotion, she startles a squirrel in the grass, and it darts past her into the bushes.

Then, before she knows it, she’s face-to-face with a woman hunter pointing an arrow down at her.

The fairy is so afraid that it actually stops her from leaking for now. She’s caught scrambling on the ground, with her ass up in the air and her thighs dripping wet. It’s so lewd and embarrassing. She looks and feels completely pitiful.

The hunter is hooded, but as the fairy looks up at her from the ground, she can see a scar carved from her face. She’s dead serious, and her bow is pointed right at the fairy’s pathetic display.

I’m going to die peeing myself, she thinks.

“Please don’t kill me!” the fairy begs the hunter towering over her. Her body remembers how urgently she needs to pee and she wiggles her butt back and forth unconsciously. The hunter gives it a quick, confused, glance. “Or capture me and sell me! Or cut me up into pieces and eat me! Please, I’m not tasty at all, I’m—ah!”

A sudden wave hits and her hands press helplessly into her crotch. Another spurt of rainbowy, iridescent fairy piss cascades through her fingers, and the droplets cling to the clovers underneath her like morning dew. Her garb, resembling a human’s leotard, grows saturated as she rubs against it to stop the flow. Eventually, she overpowers her desire to pee and she’s able to stop, though she’s left writhing on the ground with need.

“Please,” she gasps, “please, please…”

The hunter awkwardly lowers her bow. “…You scared it away.”

The piss-filled fairy looks up at her with tear-filled eyes. “…What?”

“The squirrel I was hunting. That was supposed to be my lunch.”

The fairy doesn’t know what to say. “…I’m sorry.”

There’s the rustling of a crowd, and rough “It went this way!” shouts, approaching from behind her again. The fairy gasps in fear and her wings flap about in a frenzy, and with the little willpower she has left plus pure adrenaline, she’s able to lift her heavy bladder off the ground and take off into the air again. She leaves the stranger behind. That hunter, instead of pursuing her, just watches her go, face blank. When she looks down at the grass, she notices that the fairy had left behind a little trail of shiny liquid.

The fairy is leaking bit by bit now, but even as her bladder loses its strength, she never gives up. She squeezes her legs together tightly as she flies, even if it causes her to lose her balance, and refuses to wet herself.

This is a life-or-death matter, after all. If these ruffians were to capture her, she might be imprisoned forever, chained up in a dungeon someplace and forced to drink and hold copious amounts. A fairy’s urine gained more magic the longer it remained in their bladder, so they’d train her to hold it for ages to increase its value, and punish her for peeing too soon. Then when she held as much as her poor body could physically manage, when she was quite literally bursting with pee, they’d strip her waist and collect every drop of that pee to sell. She’d do this in perpetuity, drinking and holding and holding and holding and peeing, like a little pissing machine.

The fairy has heard of others that suffered this fate, and she’s terrified of it. So she absolutely won’t wet herself here, and even if her body betrayed her, she’d fight it every step of the way. Even as the leaks grow heavier, and a stream of warm pee drips from her bare feet while she flies, she fights to hold it in.

She has to stop peeing! She lands shakily on her feet, using the base of a tree for support, and presses hard on her soaked, tingling pussy. She feels another leak despite her best efforts, and makes little hops in place and moans with desperation. But she’s determined. If she could just take a second, she could hold it a little longer and make it somewhere she could pee. If she could just…

An arrow whizzes past her ear and sticks into the bark of the tree behind her. The fairy freezes, and another jet of piss bursts from her and patters to the grass. They’ve followed the trail of her pee and they’ve found her.

One by one, the hunters emerge from the thickets, carefully surrounding her so as not to scare her away. They growl orders not to move so they don’t have to hurt her, and they each have bows or clubs or guns, all trained her way. She even spots the glint of a sword, and believing she may be carved up for meat, another fearful leak runs down her legs.

One approaches with, instead of a weapon, a glass bottle in his hands. “Don’t waste it, now,” he says in a hatefully low voice so as not to scare any more piss out of her. “Go in this.”

The fairy shakes her head, growing more and more frightened with each step the awful man takes toward her, till tears spring from her eyes and her face is just as wet as her thighs. She doesn’t want to! She doesn’t want to be kept like a farm animal for her pee! She doesn’t want to let it out in front of all these leering men! But she has to pee so badly, so, so badly, that the glass bottle almost looks inviting. Oh, gods, she wants to pee. She wants to stop fighting it and let it out. Crying in despair, her fingers twitch to accept the bottle from the hunter, when—

A boot stamps the space in front of her, and before her is a cloaked stranger’s back. That stranger plants herself firmly in between the fairy and the hunters, staring down the party, with a bow and arrow raised in opposition.

The woman spoke strongly, not inviting any protests: “She isn’t your prey.”

The hunters immediately throw an uproar of angry curses her way, but they don’t advance any further. Evil as they may seem to the fairy, they aren’t out to kill humans, and none of their empty threats toward the woman hunter seem to have any effect. She’s not budging. While the party voices its dissatisfaction, the cloaked hunter speaks to the fairy in a softer tone, just above a whisper.

“There’s a branch of the stream just behind you. You can make it that far, right?”

She is referring to the stream which earned Littlestream its name. It weaves through the town and forest like a web, nourishing the land. Its thin rivulets could be found anywhere. In Littlestream, you can always hear the sound of running water.

The stream! What a perfect idea! If the fairy relieved herself there, the evidence would be washed away immediately, and there’d be nothing for the hunters to collect. And with the cloaked hunter covering her, she just might have a few seconds of privacy. Finally, an opportunity to pee…! The fairy cups her hands to her crotch and makes a desperate dash in that direction. She can’t spare a word of thanks to the hunter—she doesn’t have enough time, and all that would come out of her mouth are desperate little whimpers.

Thankfully, the stream comes into view before long. It glimmers heroically in the sun, welcoming her to lay down her burden. The fairy starts peeing uncontrollably the second her toes touch the water. She splashes unceremoniously up to her knees, spreads her legs apart a little, and stops fighting it. Piss explodes from her. She doesn’t bother removing her leotard, so the rainbowy piss gushes forth from it and waterfalls into the stream below, warming it and making it shimmer like stars. 

It keeps coming and coming, and her tears fall from the sheer relief of it. It feels so good that, unconsciously, her fingertips dip over her pussy again, gently this time, so she can feel the warm pee pumping out of her. Piss sprays out in all directions through her fingers. She keeps going and going, draining her poor, exhausted body. Her knees quiver, hardly able to keep her standing. Eventually the flow tapers, and little by little trickles to a stop, and she whines in disappointment and rubs over the soaked fabric clinging to her pussy, wishing she could pee more.

Another rustling behind her brings her back to her senses, and she whips around in panic. The cloaked hunter emerges again, but with her bow lowered this time. Regardless, the fairy squeaks in fear and drops down into a squat right away, hiding her lower half in the flowing water.

“What—What—What do you want?” she stammers out. “What happened to the others?”

“I got them to leave.” The stranger continues to approach casually, as if not sensing the fairy’s fear at all. “There’s a big penalty for poaching another hunter’s prey down at the guild. I bluffed and tossed some accusations around, and they figured they shouldn’t stick around any longer.”

The fairy trembles, partially because she has nowhere to run and partially because she's still all tingly after peeing like that. “Then I’m your prey now.”

“What? No, like I said, the squirrel was my prey. It’s mostly their fault it got scared away, anyway.”

The fairy doesn’t believe what she’s hearing. “Then you don’t want me?”

“Why would I want you?”

“I-I mean, humans are always trying to capture us! They say we’ll make them a lot of money!”

“Humans? Us?” The cloaked head tilts slightly to the side. Though this person’s face is obscured, the fairy feels eyes on her, and she shrinks back in intimidation. Finally, the hunter says incredulously, “…You’re a fairy!”

“Did you just notice?!”

Did the delicate wings not give it away? The sweet pink flowers decorating her body? All the sparkles and the fact that her piss was rainbow-colored? How imperceptive could a hunter be?!

“My bad.” She finally removes her hood, and the fairy sees a mess of auburn hair, like leaves in the fall, tied into a thick braid. Her features could be described as mean-looking, but there’s no ill intent on her expression at all. On her face is a crooked scar that hooks up through her right eye, which is glassier than her left. “My eyesight’s not great.”

The fairy is stunned into silence at the sight of her. By all accounts, she should look scary, but the more the fairy looks at her, the more kindness she can spot in that intimidating face. When the hunter steps into the water with her and extends a hand, the fairy forgets to flinch away.

“Need a hand getting out?” she asks, and instead of violently grabbing her like the fairy expected a human to do, she patiently waits with her arm outstretched. “You’ll catch a cold.”

Suddenly very flustered, the fairy plunges her dirty hands into the water to rinse them off. When she finishes, she takes that stranger’s rough hand. With her help, she stands, exposing her wet butt to the cold air. Once the hunter safely escorts her to the bank, she sheds her cloak entirely and wraps the fairy in it. The fairy freezes as she’s bundled up against her will. But these aren’t restraints. It’s meant to dry her off.

“You don’t have to worry,” the hunter says as she fastens the cloak to the shorter girl. “I only hunt to feed myself or to earn a bounty. I’ve got no interest in catching magical creatures for fun. Do you have a name?”

Against her better judgement, the blushing fairy blurts out, “Peony. You really aren’t going to kidnap me?”

“I’m Rayla. I really won’t.” That scary face cracks into a smile. “But maybe I’ll come again to talk to you. I’ve never met a fairy before.”

She turns a new shade of pink. “…You saved me today. How can I thank you?”

“Let’s see…” Rayla makes a big show of thinking about it. “…For starters, you owe me lunch.”
