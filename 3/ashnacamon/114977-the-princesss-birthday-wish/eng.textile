This doesn’t seem great to me, but I had this idea. If this is a load of crappy writing I do apologize.

This is supposed to be not too modern generally, but toilets do exist. I imagined Suzan looking a lot like lameboast’s Strife, but you can imagine her however you want. She is 24 at the start of the story. If that doesn’t fit “juvenile,” I’m sorry I misunderstand the word.

Anyway, without further ado…

Suzan wandered off into the dark maze of rose bushes, or at least she meant to look as if she was wandering. In reality, the juvenile princess was looking for a place to pee. Now, she could have simply made her way indoors and found a bathroom, but this was easier and quicker, and (though she wouldn’t want to admit it) more thrilling. She liked being able to pee standing up, without worrying about keeping things tidy, and only barely enough care to make sure she didn’t get her dress wet.

Sometimes, she wished that she could piss wildly, in great volumes like a big draft horse boy from one of the country farms, but with her petite canine body. Now was one of those times, and as she began peeing into a hedge wall near the central fountain, she pushed a little to make it more ferocious. This never seemed to do much in terms of making her faster, but she liked to think of her bladder just exploding with piss, and this was an easy way to at least somewhat simulate that. She gave a delighted sigh.

“Suzan?”

Her mother’s clear voice came from close by. Suzan quickly halted her stream, fighting the massive spike in desperation this caused, flung her skirt down, and answered, “Yes?”

A disappointed sigh followed, “You know I could hear you, right?” Her mother emerged from around the corner. Suzan hung her head. “Suzan, you’re not going to be able to run from responsibility like this forever. One of these days you’re going to have to grow up and face who you are and what you’ll need to become.”

Suzan was utterly bewildered. “What are you talking about? I was just peeing!”

The queen’s eyes narrowed. “Not as an act of defiance because we’re here?”

“N-no! I mean, I didn’t want to come to this party, but I knew we had to, so I came. I just wanted to pee. It wasn’t to desecrate the fountain or any nonsense like that. I’m rather fond of the duchess.”

Her mother’s look softened. “Alright. I’m sorry, I… I’ve been afraid you were going to rebel like that, and I just… Oh, I’m so relieved. I am glad you came. I didn’t really want to come either. This would usually be much too late to be staying up for a party on Wednesday, but you know; her son has just come home and I wanted to pay my respects.” There was a slight pause. “You really should’ve gone inside. I mean, you might’ve gotten away with it, but I happened to want to see the fountain. It could’ve been someone else.”

This idea did rather terrify Suzan. What if a random old duke or lord had come round and seen her? That would be so embarrassing! “I’m sorry,” she said.

“It’s so pretty in the moonlight,” her mother offered a subject change, looking at the fountain. Suzan joined her in watching. It was beautiful…

Some days later, it was the eve of Suzan’s 25th birthday, and her mother called her to her chambers. Let the reader understand, when a man or woman became 21, they were considered eligible for marriage. But only when they were 25 would they be allowed to rule. Before that, if they inherited the throne, the previous monarch’s trusted advisors would oversee all decisions until they came of age. Suzan knew this, but it was because of this significance that her mother explained something she did not know.

“You know your godmother, Herrie?” The Queen asked.

“Yes…”

“Do you know what creature she is?”

“Well,” Suzan answered, “she’s like a Meu, but she does have fur, and her ears and snout are very long for them. She’s always been kind to me, but it felt rude to ask, so I just assumed that’s what she was. What is she?”

“Well, she is an enigma,” the Queen explained, “A fairy of a sort. And, to every heir on their twenty-fifth birthday, she grants one wish to keep, for as great and as long as her power lasts.”

Suzan blinked. “O-oh. Well, I… W-what do you think I should wish for?” She had a few ideas, but she knew her mother had more experience.

“Well, it really is your choice,” she replied, “I personally chose something for my own body, but it was rather silly. I wanted bigger breasts.”

“Mother!”

“I know, I know! An entire family of late bloomers, and I had a fear of being left out. Herrie came to me some years later and said that she no longer had to upkeep the transformation with her magic, because I had grown into it naturally.” She admired the royal bust. “I suppose it wasn’t a wasted wish. It taught me to be patient.” She looked back at Suzan. “But whatever you do, make sure you wish for something you really want, not just what seems would give it to you.”

Suzan pondered the decision in her spare moments all through the celebrations of the next day, but she couldn’t decide what to wish for right up until the moment Herrie asked her. Suddenly, a new idea came to her; one that seemed better than all the others. Being indecisive was hardly a ladylike thing to do, so she went for it.

“I wish,” she said, “that whenever I try to pee somewhere that isn’t proper, unless it’s an emergency or the proper place isn’t within a reasonable distance, I wouldn’t be able to relieve myself there.”

It was about two weeks after her birthday when she finally felt the effects of her new enchantment. She hadn’t tested it directly, afraid that it wouldn’t work, or worse that it would work in some horrible way like making someone show up or something. But as it happened, while she was out horse riding one day, she decided to stop and take a piss. After she had already stopped, she suddenly remembered the spell. Would the magic stop her here? The castle technically wasn’t so far away that she couldn’t make it back. It would just be uncomfortable and bothersome to do so. What was the actual definition of “proper” the spell used? What if something actually dangerous was what stopped her? But Suzan was tired of playing the “what if” game. Stepping behind a tree, she hiked up her skirt, squatted, and…

*pissssssss*

No tingle, no unbreakable wall, no consequences whatsoever. She was just peeing like she normally would.

*ssssSSSSSsssssSSs*

Suzan began to relax a little, wondering if anything actually was going to happen. Had Herrie failed?

*SSSSShssssSHSSSSss*

She gave a disappointed sigh, wondering how to tell her mother about this. Meanwhile, she might as well enjoy this pee…

*ssshshSHHHHHHHHSHHHHHHHsssssssSSHHHHHHHHHH?!?!*

Suzan had pushed, taken pause, and pushed again, but there was no let up. Why did her bladder have to be so full right now?! She could have continued, but she was getting nervous something would happen. She closed off the stream, and stood up. Looking down at her handiwork, she saw that the puddle stretched a good deal farther than any of the others she had seen herself cause.

With annoyance, she realized she still needed to pee.

In fact, she needed to pee just as much as when she started. This didn’t make any sense. She and just peed a ton, and she didn’t get any relief?

Wait, the magic. Could it have…

Suzan realized the flaw in her wording and it’s consequences. Exactly like she’d said, she hadn’t been “able to relieve herself,” but she had also directly mentioned peeing in the same sentence, meaning they were taken as two different things. She could still pee wherever she wanted, but unless it was a proper place, she would just keep peeing, and never… get… any relief…

Suzan began panting as her face went bright red. For what the wish was meant to do, this was the worst possible outcome, and she was so into it.

Barely with her wits about her, she hiked up her skirt again, and peed standing up. The loud splatter reminded her that this was no small stream, but her bladder’s need had exactly as much quenching from it as a greedy king does from increased taxes. She pushed and pushed, as hard as she could stand it, but the magic immovably kept up and her bladder never got any less full. She pissed like crazy for an unmeasured amount of time, reveling in the release. It stayed perfectly at its peak, feeling as if it was just about to reduce the pressure, but always staying at it. Until finally, she couldn’t take it anymore and absolutely crashed into an orgasm. Her knees gave way, and she stumbled backwards, falling to the ground and peeing helplessly into her skirt.

I’ve got ideas for more, but not sure how to connect them to this one. Any suggestions are welcome… sort of.

How about a situation with her being on some kinda dancing ball and she puts off her needs because a couple of higher ranked nobles ask her to dance before she can excuse herself?

Well, that would have no use of her powers that I can see, and also I don’t like desperation for its own.

Unless…

Isn't the thing that she won't get her relief in that case /won't actually stop wetting herself inside the ball hall?

That is the great “unless,” but she would have to get pretty desperate. I did mistakenly think she would have to get all the way to medical maximum, but not so.

Maybe something unexpected happens (like someone mixes something into her drink 🤔)

Why?

I am working on the next chapter already, but it could fit in somehow if there was enough reason for it.
