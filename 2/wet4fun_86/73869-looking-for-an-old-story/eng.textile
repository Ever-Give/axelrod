I have been searching for an old story I read years ago somewhere but can’t find it. I know I saw again posted on this site in the last year or two. It was a guy at a concert in a bar who meets a girl but her friend is drunk and kinda obnoxious. The friend starts to notice that he keeps looking towards the rest rooms. She starts teasing him about needing to pee but he denies it being a problem. She even buys him beers. The teasing continues until he’s leaking in his pants. He for sure was wearing light jeans and maybe like a white sweater. He ends up having an accident and is totally humiliated. The girl he likes is sympathetic but her friends continue teasing him mercilessly. The bartender further humiliates him by kicking him out and telling him not to come back without his diapers and warns him she will be checking. If anyone remembers this story and can point me in the direction of it it would be greatly appreciated!
