Trying to find a story

So there was a story that I think was called ‘Unbearably Long Hold’ about a cruel businesswoman who went on a 2 week company trip and held it the whole time, paying her personal driver like 1000 dollars to tell no one about her squirming in the car (although he instead decided to secretly record her squirming and sell off the pictures to people that hated her)

And now I cannot find the story anywhere. Was it deleted? And if so, does anyone have it saved?
